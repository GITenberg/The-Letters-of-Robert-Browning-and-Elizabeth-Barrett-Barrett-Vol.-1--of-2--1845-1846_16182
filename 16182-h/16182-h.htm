<h2>
    NOTE
</h2>
<p>
    In considering the question of publishing these letters, which are all
    that ever passed between my father and mother, for after their
    marriage they were never separated, it seemed to me that my only
    alternatives were to allow them to be published or to destroy them. I
    might, indeed, have left the matter to the decision of others after my
    death, but that would be evading a responsibility which I feel that I
    ought to accept.
</p>
<p>
    Ever since my mother's death these letters were kept by my father in a
    certain inlaid box, into which they exactly fitted, and where they
    have always rested, letter beside letter, each in its consecutive
    order and numbered on the envelope by his own hand.
</p>
<p>
    My father destroyed all the rest of his correspondence, and not long
    before his death he said, referring to these letters: 'There they are,
    do with them as you please when I am dead and gone!'
</p>
<p>
    A few of the letters are of little or no interest, but their omission
    would have saved only a few pages, and I think it well that the
    correspondence should be given in its entirety.
</p>
<p>
    I wish to express my gratitude to my father's friend and mine, Mrs.
    Miller Morison, for her unfailing sympathy and assistance in
    deciphering some words which had become scarcely legible owing to
    faded ink.

    The correspondence contained in these volumes is printed exactly as it
    appears in the original letters, without alteration, except in respect
    of obvious slips of the pen. Even the punctuation, with its
    characteristic dots and dashes, has for the most part been preserved.
    The notes in square brackets [] have been added mainly in order to
    translate the Greek phrases, and to give the references to Greek
    poets. For these, thanks are due to Mr. F.G. Kenyon, who has revised
    the proofs with the assistance of Mr. Roger Ingpen, the latter being
    responsible for the Index.

</p>
<p>
    I <SPAN class="sc-ex">love</span> your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;and this is
    no off-hand complimentary letter that I shall write,&mdash;whatever else,
    no prompt matter-of-course recognition of your genius, and there a
    graceful and natural end of the thing. Since the day last week when I
    first read your poems, I quite laugh to remember how I have been
    turning and turning again in my mind what I should be able to tell you
    of their effect upon me, for in the first flush of delight I thought I
    would this once get out of my habit of purely passive enjoyment, when
    I do really enjoy, and thoroughly justify my admiration&mdash;perhaps even,
    as a loyal fellow-craftsman should, try and find fault and do you some
    little good to be proud of hereafter!&mdash;but nothing comes of it all&mdash;so
    into me has it gone, and part of me has it become, this great living
    poetry of yours, not a flower of which but took root and grew&mdash;Oh, how
    different that is from lying to be dried and pressed flat, and prized
    highly, and put in a book with a proper account at top and bottom,
    and shut up and put away ... and the book called a 'Flora,' besides!
    After all, I need not give up the thought of doing that, too, in time;
    because even now, talking with whoever is worthy, I can give a reason
    for my faith in one and another excellence, the fresh strange music,
    the affluent language, the exquisite pathos and true new brave
    thought; but in this addressing myself to you&mdash;your own self, and for
    the first time, my feeling rises altogether. I do, as I say, love
    these books with all my heart&mdash;and I love you too. Do you know I was
    once not very far from seeing&mdash;really seeing you? Mr. Kenyon said to
    me one morning 'Would you like to see Miss Barrett?' then he went to
    announce me,&mdash;then he returned ... you were too unwell, and now it is
    years ago, and I feel as at some untoward passage in my travels, as if
    I had been close, so close, to some world's-wonder in chapel or crypt,
    only a screen to push and I might have entered, but there was some
    slight, so it now seems, slight and just sufficient bar to admission,
    and the half-opened door shut, and I went home my thousands of miles,
    and the sight was never to be?
</p>
<p>
    Well, these Poems were to be, and this true thankful joy and pride
    with which I feel myself,
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&nbsp;Yours ever faithfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h3>
    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">50 Wimpole Street: Jan. 11, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    I thank you, dear Mr. Browning, from the bottom of my heart. You meant
    to give me pleasure by your letter&mdash;and even if the object had not
    been answered, I ought still to thank you. But it is thoroughly
    answered. Such a letter from such a hand! Sympathy is dear&mdash;very dear
    to me: but the sympathy of a poet, and of such a poet, is the
    quintessence of sympathy to me! Will you take back my gratitude for
    it?&mdash;agreeing, too, that of all the commerce done in the world, from
    Tyre to Carthage, the exchange of sympathy for gratitude is the most
    princely thing!
</p>
<p>
    For the rest you draw me on with your kindness. It is difficult to get
    rid of people when you once have given them too much pleasure&mdash;<i>that</i>
    is a fact, and we will not stop for the moral of it. What I was going
    to say&mdash;after a little natural hesitation&mdash;is, that if ever you emerge
    without inconvenient effort from your 'passive state,' and will <i>tell</i>
    me of such faults as rise to the surface and strike you as important
    in my poems, (for of course, I do not think of troubling you with
    criticism in detail) you will confer a lasting obligation on me, and
    one which I shall value so much, that I covet it at a distance. I do
    not pretend to any extraordinary meekness under criticism and it is
    possible enough that I might not be altogether obedient to yours. But
    with my high respect for your power in your Art and for your
    experience as an artist, it would be quite impossible for me to hear a
    general observation of yours on what appear to you my master-faults,
    without being the better for it hereafter in some way. I ask for only
    a sentence or two of general observation&mdash;and I do not ask even for
    <i>that</i>, so as to tease you&mdash;but in the humble, low voice, which is so
    excellent a thing in women&mdash;particularly when they go a-begging! The
    most frequent general criticism I receive, is, I think, upon the
    style,&mdash;'if I <i>would</i> but change my style'! But <i>that</i> is an objection
    (isn't it?) to the writer bodily? Buffon says, and every sincere
    writer must feel, that '<i>Le style c'est l'homme</i>'; a fact, however,
    scarcely calculated to lessen the objection with certain critics.
</p>
<p>
    Is it indeed true that I was so near to the pleasure and honour of
    making your acquaintance? and can it be true that you look back upon
    the lost opportunity with any regret? <i>But</i>&mdash;you know&mdash;if you had
    entered the 'crypt,' you might have caught cold, or been tired to
    death, and <i>wished</i> yourself 'a thousand miles off;' which would have
    been worse than travelling them. It is not my interest, however, to
    put such thoughts in your head about its being 'all for the best'; and
    I would rather hope (as I do) that what I lost by one chance I may
    recover by some future one. Winters shut me up as they do dormouse's
    eyes; in the spring, <i>we shall see</i>: and I am so much better that I
    seem turning round to the outward world again. And in the meantime I
    have learnt to know your voice, not merely from the poetry but from
    the kindness in it. Mr. Kenyon often speaks of you&mdash;dear Mr.
    Kenyon!&mdash;who most unspeakably, or only speakably with tears in my
    eyes,&mdash;has been my friend and helper, and my book's friend and helper!
    critic and sympathiser, true friend of all hours! You know him well
    enough, I think, to understand that I must be grateful to him.
</p>
<p>
    I am writing too much,&mdash;and notwithstanding that I am writing too
    much, I will write of one thing more. I will say that I am your
    debtor, not only for this cordial letter and for all the pleasure
    which came with it, but in other ways, and those the highest: and I
    will say that while I live to follow this divine art of poetry, in
    proportion to my love for it and my devotion to it, I must be a devout
    admirer and student of your works. This is in my heart to say to
    you&mdash;and I say it.
</p>
<p>
    And, for the rest, I am proud to remain</p>

<h3>
    <i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">New Cross, Hatcham, Surrey.<br>
Jan. 13, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;I just shall say, in as few words as I can, that
    you make me very happy, and that, now the beginning is over, I dare
    say I shall do better, because my poor praise, number one, was nearly
    as felicitously brought out, as a certain tribute to no less a
    personage than Tasso, which I was amused with at Rome some weeks ago,
    in a neat pencilling on the plaister-wall by his tomb at
    Sant'Onofrio&mdash;'Alla cara memoria&mdash;di&mdash;(please fancy solemn interspaces
    and grave capital letters at the new lines) di&mdash;Torquato Tasso&mdash;il
    Dottore Bernardini&mdash;offriva&mdash;il seguente Carme&mdash;<i>O tu</i>'&mdash;and no
    more,&mdash;the good man, it should seem, breaking down with the overload
    of love here! But my 'O tu'&mdash;was breathed out most sincerely, and now
    you have taken it in gracious part, the rest will come after.
    Only,&mdash;and which is why I write now&mdash;it looks as if I have introduced
    some phrase or other about 'your faults' so cleverly as to give
    exactly the opposite meaning to what I meant, which was, that in my
    first ardour I had thought to tell you of <i>everything</i> which impressed
    me in your verses, down, even, to whatever 'faults' I could find,&mdash;a
    good earnest, when I had got to <i>them</i>, that I had left out not much
    between&mdash;as if some Mr. Fellows were to say, in the overflow of his
    first enthusiasm of rewarded adventure: 'I will describe you all the
    outer life and ways of these Lycians, down to their very
    sandal-thongs,' whereto the be-corresponded one rejoins&mdash;'Shall I get
    next week, then, your dissertation on sandal-thongs'? Yes, and a
    little about the 'Olympian Horses,' and God-charioteers as well!
</p>
<p>
    What 'struck me as faults,' were not matters on the removal of which,
    one was to have&mdash;poetry, or high poetry,&mdash;but the very highest poetry,
    so I thought, and that, to universal recognition. For myself, or any
    artist, in many of the cases there would be a positive loss of time,
    peculiar artist's pleasure&mdash;for an instructed eye loves to see where
    the brush has dipped twice in a lustrous colour, has lain insistingly
    along a favourite outline, dwelt lovingly in a grand shadow; for these
    'too muches' for the everybody's picture are so many helps to the
    making out the real painter's picture as he had it in his brain. And
    all of the Titian's Naples Magdalen must have once been golden in its
    degree to justify that heap of hair in her hands&mdash;the <i>only</i> gold
    effected now!
</p>
<p>
    But about this soon&mdash;for night is drawing on and I go out, yet cannot,
    quiet at conscience, till I report (to <i>myself</i>, for I never said it
    to you, I think) that your poetry must be, cannot but be, infinitely
    more to me than mine to you&mdash;for you <i>do</i> what I always wanted, hoped
    to do, and only seem now likely to do for the first time. You speak
    out, <i>you</i>,&mdash;I only make men and women speak&mdash;give you truth broken
    into prismatic hues, and fear the pure white light, even if it is in
    me, but I am going to try; so it will be no small comfort to have your
    company just now, seeing that when you have your men and women
    aforesaid, you are busied with them, whereas it seems bleak,
    melancholy work, this talking to the wind (for I have begun)&mdash;yet I
    don't think I shall let <i>you</i> hear, after all, the savage things about
    Popes and imaginative religions that I must say.
</p>
<p>
    See how I go on and on to you, I who, whenever now and then pulled, by
    the head and hair, into letter-writing, get sorrowfully on for a line
    or two, as the cognate creature urged on by stick and string, and then
    come down 'flop' upon the sweet haven of page one, line last, as
    serene as the sleep of the virtuous! You will never more, I hope, talk
    of 'the honour of my acquaintance,' but I will joyfully wait for the
    delight of your friendship, and the spring, and my Chapel-sight after
    all!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">
    Ever yours most faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><SPAN class="sc-ex">R. Browning</span>.
</p>
<p>
    For Mr. Kenyon&mdash;I have a convenient theory about <i>him</i>, and his
    otherwise quite unaccountable kindness to me; but 'tis quite night
    now, and they call me.

<br>

<h3>
    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">50 Wimpole Street: Jan. 15, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    Dear Mr. Browning,&mdash;The fault was clearly with me and not with you.
</p>
<p>
    When I had an Italian master, years ago, he told me that there was an
    unpronounceable English word which absolutely expressed me, and which
    he would say in his own tongue, as he could not in mine&mdash;'<i>testa
    lunga</i>.' Of course, the signor meant <i>headlong</i>!&mdash;and now I have had
    enough to tame me, and might be expected to stand still in my stall.
    But you see I do not. Headlong I was at first, and headlong I
    continue&mdash;precipitously rushing forward through all manner of nettles
    and briars instead of keeping the path; guessing at the meaning of
    unknown words instead of looking into the dictionary&mdash;tearing open
    letters, and never untying a string,&mdash;and expecting everything to be
    done in a minute, and the thunder to be as quick as the lightning. And
    so, at your half word I flew at the whole one, with all its possible
    consequences, and wrote what you read. Our common friend, as I think
    he is, Mr. Horne, is often forced to entreat me into patience and
    coolness of purpose, though his only intercourse with me has been by
    letter. And, by the way, you will be sorry to hear that during his
    stay in Germany <i>he</i> has been 'headlong' (out of a metaphor) twice;
    once, in falling from the Drachenfels, when he only just saved himself
    by catching at a vine; and once quite lately, at Christmas, in a fall
    on the ice of the Elbe in skating, when he dislocated his left
    shoulder in a very painful manner. He is doing quite well, I believe,
    but it was sad to have such a shadow from the German Christmas tree,
    and he a stranger.
</p>
<p>
    In art, however, I understand that it does not do to be headlong, but
    patient and laborious&mdash;and there is a love strong enough, even in me, to
    overcome nature. I apprehend what you mean in the criticism you just
    intimate, and shall turn it over and over in my mind until I get practical
    good from it. What no mere critic sees, but what you, an artist, know, is
    the difference between the thing desired and the thing attained, between the
    idea in the writer's mind and the <span title="eidôlon">&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span> cast off in his work. All the effort&mdash;the quick'ning of the
    breath and beating of the heart in pursuit, which is ruffling and
    injurious to the general effect of a composition; all which you call
    'insistency,' and which many would call superfluity, and which <i>is</i>
    superfluous in a sense&mdash;<i>you</i> can pardon, because you understand. The
    great chasm between the thing I say, and the thing I would say, would
    be quite dispiriting to me, in spite even of such kindnesses as yours,
    if the desire did not master the despondency. 'Oh for a horse with
    wings!' It is wrong of me to write so of myself&mdash;only you put your
    finger on the root of a fault, which has, to my fancy, been a little
    misapprehended. I do not <i>say everything I think</i> (as has been said of
    me by master-critics) but I <i>take every means to say what I think</i>,
    which is different!&mdash;or I fancy so!
</p>
<p>
    In one thing, however, you are wrong. Why should you deny the full
    measure of my delight and benefit from your writings? I could tell you
    why you should not. You have in your vision two worlds, or to use the
    language of the schools of the day, you are both subjective and
    objective in the habits of your mind. You can deal both with abstract
    thought and with human passion in the most passionate sense. Thus, you
    have an immense grasp in Art; and no one at all accustomed to consider
    the usual forms of it, could help regarding with reverence and
    gladness the gradual expansion of your powers. Then you are
    'masculine' to the height&mdash;and I, as a woman, have studied some of
    your gestures of language and intonation wistfully, as a thing beyond
    me far! and the more admirable for being beyond.
</p>
<p>
    Of your new work I hear with delight. How good of you to tell me. And
    it is not dramatic in the strict sense, I am to understand&mdash;(am I
    right in understanding so?) and you speak, in your own person 'to the
    winds'? no&mdash;but to the thousand living sympathies which will awake to
    hear you. A great dramatic power may develop itself otherwise than in
    the formal drama; and I have been guilty of wishing, before this hour
    (for reasons which I will not thrust upon you after all my tedious
    writing), that you would give the public a poem unassociated directly
    or indirectly with the stage, for a trial on the popular heart. I
    reverence the drama, but&mdash;
</p>

<p>
    Dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;Your books lie on my table here, at arm's length
    from me, in this old room where I sit all day: and when my head aches
    or wanders or strikes work, as it now or then will, I take my chance
    for either green-covered volume, as if it were so much fresh trefoil
    to feel in one's hands this winter-time,&mdash;and round I turn, and,
    putting a decisive elbow on three or four half-done-with 'Bells' of
    mine, read, read, read, and just as I have shut up the book and walked
    to the window, I recollect that you wanted me to find faults there,
    and that, in an unwise hour, I engaged to do so. Meantime, the days
    go by (the whitethroat is come and sings now) and as I would not have
    you 'look down on me from your white heights' as promise breaker,
    evader, or forgetter, if I could help: and as, if I am very candid and
    contrite, you may find it in your heart to write to me again&mdash;who
    knows?&mdash;I shall say at once that the said faults cannot be lost, must
    be <i>somewhere</i>, and shall be faithfully brought you back whenever they
    turn up,&mdash;as people tell one of missing matters. I am rather exacting,
    myself, with my own gentle audience, and get to say spiteful things
    about them when they are backward in their dues of appreciation&mdash;but
    really, <i>really</i>&mdash;could I be quite sure that anybody as good as&mdash;I
    must go on, I suppose, and say&mdash;as myself, even, were honestly to feel
    towards me as I do, towards the writer of 'Bertha,' and the 'Drama,'
    and the 'Duchess,' and the 'Page' and&mdash;the whole two volumes, I should
    be paid after a fashion, I know.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I can do&mdash;pencil, if you like, and annotate, and dissertate
    upon that I love most and least&mdash;I think I can do it, that is.
</p>
<p>
    Here an odd memory comes&mdash;of a friend who,&mdash;volunteering such a
    service to a sonnet-writing somebody, gave him a taste of his quality
    in a side-column of short criticisms on sonnet the First, and starting
    off the beginning three lines with, of course, 'bad, worse,
    worst'&mdash;made by a generous mintage of words to meet the sudden run of
    his epithets, 'worser, worserer, worserest' pay off the second terzet
    in full&mdash;no 'badder, badderer, badderest' fell to the <i>Second's</i>
    allowance, and 'worser' &amp;c. answered the demands of the Third;
    'worster, worsterer, worsterest' supplied the emergency of the Fourth;
    and, bestowing his last 'worserestest and worstestest' on lines 13 and
    14, my friend (slapping his forehead like an emptied strong-box)
    frankly declared himself bankrupt, and honourably incompetent, to
    satisfy the reasonable expectations of the rest of the series!
</p>
<p>
    What an illustration of the law by which opposite ideas suggest
    opposite, and contrary images come together!
</p>
<p>
    See now, how, of that 'Friendship' you offer me (and here Juliet's
    word rises to my lips)&mdash;I feel sure once and for ever. I have got
    already, I see, into this little pet-handwriting of mine (not anyone
    else's) which scratches on as if theatrical copyists (ah me!) and
    <SPAN class="sc-ex">Bradbury and Evans' Reader</span> were not! But you shall get something
    better than this nonsense one day, if you will have patience with
    me&mdash;hardly better, though, because this does me real good, gives real
    relief, to write. After all, you know nothing, next to nothing of me,
    and that stops me. Spring is to come, however!
</p>
<p>
    If you hate writing to me as I hate writing to nearly everybody, I
    pray you never write&mdash;if you do, as you say, care for anything I have
    done. I will simply assure you, that meaning to begin work in deep
    earnest, <i>begin</i> without affectation, God knows,&mdash;I do not know what
    will help me more than hearing from you,&mdash;and therefore, if you do not
    so very much hate it, I know I <i>shall</i> hear from you&mdash;and very little
    more about your 'tiring me.'

<i>[Transcriber's Note: So in original. Should be "Wimpole Street."] </i>
</p>
<p>
    Why how could I hate to write to you, dear Mr. Browning? Could you
    believe in such a thing? If nobody likes writing to everybody (except
    such professional letter writers as you and I are <i>not</i>), yet
    everybody likes writing to somebody, and it would be strange and
    contradictory if I were not always delighted both to hear from <i>you</i>
    and to write to <i>you</i>, this talking upon paper being as good a social
    pleasure as another, when our means are somewhat straitened. As for
    me, I have done most of my talking by post of late years&mdash;as people
    shut up in dungeons take up with scrawling mottoes on the walls. Not
    that I write to many in the way of regular correspondence, as our
    friend Mr. Horne predicates of me in his romances (which is mere
    romancing!), but that there are a few who will write and be written to
    by me without a sense of injury. Dear Miss Mitford, for instance. You
    do not know her, I think, personally, although she was the first to
    tell me (when I was very ill and insensible to all the glories of the
    world except poetry), of the grand scene in 'Pippa Passes.' <i>She</i> has
    filled a large drawer in this room with delightful letters, heart-warm
    and soul-warm, ... driftings of nature (if sunshine could drift like
    snow), and which, if they should ever fall the way of all writing,
    into print, would assume the folio shape as a matter of course, and
    take rank on the lowest shelf of libraries, with Benedictine editions
    of the Fathers, <span title="k.t.l.">&kappa;.&tau;.&lambda;</span>. I write this to you to show how I can
    have pleasure in letters, and never think them too long, nor too
    frequent, nor too illegible from being written in little 'pet hands.'
    I can read any MS. except the writing on the pyramids. And if you will
    only promise to treat me <i>en bon camarade</i>, without reference to the
    conventionalities of 'ladies and gentlemen,' taking no thought for
    your sentences (nor for mine), nor for your blots (nor for mine), nor
    for your blunt speaking (nor for mine), nor for your badd speling (nor
    for mine), and if you agree to send me a blotted thought whenever you
    are in the mind for it, and with as little ceremony and less
    legibility than you would think it necessary to employ towards your
    printer&mdash;why, <i>then</i>, I am ready to sign and seal the contract, and to
    rejoice in being 'articled' as your correspondent. Only <i>don't</i> let us
    have any constraint, any ceremony! <i>Don't</i> be civil to me when you
    feel rude,&mdash;nor loquacious when you incline to silence,&mdash;nor yielding
    in the manners when you are perverse in the mind. See how out of the
    world I am! Suffer me to profit by it in almost the only profitable
    circumstance, and let us rest from the bowing and the courtesying,
    you and I, on each side. You will find me an honest man on the whole,
    if rather hasty and prejudging, which is a different thing from
    prejudice at the worst. And we have great sympathies in common, and I
    am inclined to look up to you in many things, and to learn as much of
    everything as you will teach me. On the other hand you must prepare
    yourself to forbear and to forgive&mdash;will you? While I throw off the
    ceremony, I hold the faster to the kindness.
</p>
<p>
    Is it true, as you say, that I 'know so "little"' of you? And is it
    true, as others say, that the productions of an artist do not partake
    of his real nature, ... that in the minor sense, man is not made in
    the image of God? It is <i>not</i> true, to my mind&mdash;and therefore it is
    not true that I know little of you, except in as far as it is true
    (which I believe) that your greatest works are to come. Need I assure
    you that I shall always hear with the deepest interest every word you
    will say to me of what you are doing or about to do? I hear of the
    'old room' and the '"Bells" lying about,' with an interest which you
    may guess at, perhaps. And when you tell me besides, of <i>my poems
    being there</i>, and of your caring for them so much beyond the tide-mark
    of my hopes, the pleasure rounds itself into a charm, and prevents its
    own expression. Overjoyed I am with this cordial sympathy&mdash;but it is
    better, I feel, to try to justify it by future work than to thank you
    for it now. I think&mdash;if I may dare to name myself with you in the
    poetic relation&mdash;that we both have high views of the Art we follow,
    and stedfast purpose in the pursuit of it, and that we should not,
    either of <i>us</i>, be likely to be thrown from the course, by the casting
    of any Atalanta-ball of speedy popularity. But I do not know, I cannot
    guess, whether you are liable to be pained deeply by hard criticism
    and cold neglect, such as original writers like yourself are too often
    exposed to&mdash;or whether the love of Art is enough for you, and the
    exercise of Art the filling joy of your life. Not that praise must not
    always, of necessity, be delightful to the artist, but that it may be
    redundant to his content. Do you think so? or not? It appears to me
    that poets who, like Keats, are highly susceptible to criticism, must
    be jealous, in their own persons, of the future honour of their works.
    Because, if a work is worthy, honour must follow it, though the worker
    should not live to see that following overtaking. Now, is it not
    enough that the work be honoured&mdash;enough I mean, for the worker? And
    is it not enough to keep down a poet's ordinary wearing anxieties, to
    think, that if his work be worthy it will have honour, and, if not,
    that 'Sparta must have nobler sons than he'? I am writing nothing
    applicable, I see, to anything in question, but when one falls into a
    favourite train of thought, one indulges oneself in thinking on. I
    began in thinking and wondering what sort of artistic constitution you
    had, being determined, as you may observe (with a sarcastic smile at
    the impertinence), to set about knowing as much as possible of you
    immediately. Then you spoke of your 'gentle audience' (<i>you began</i>),
    and I, who know that you have not one but many enthusiastic
    admirers&mdash;the 'fit and few' in the intense meaning&mdash;yet not the
    <i>diffused</i> fame which will come to you presently, wrote on, down the
    margin of the subject, till I parted from it altogether. But, after
    all, we are on the proper matter of sympathy. And after all, and after
    all that has been said and mused upon the 'natural ills,' the anxiety,
    and wearing out experienced by the true artist,&mdash;is not the <i>good</i>
    immeasurably greater than the <i>evil</i>? Is it not great good, and great
    joy? For my part, I wonder sometimes&mdash;I surprise myself wondering&mdash;how
    without such an object and purpose of life, people find it worth while
    to live at all. And, for happiness&mdash;why, my only idea of happiness, as
    far as my personal enjoyment is concerned, (but I have been
    straightened in some respects and in comparison with the majority of
    livers!) lies deep in poetry and its associations. And then, the
    escape from pangs of heart and bodily weakness&mdash;when you throw off
    <i>yourself</i>&mdash;what you feel to be <i>yourself</i>&mdash;into another atmosphere
    and into other relations where your life may spread its wings out new,
    and gather on every separate plume a brightness from the sun of the
    sun! Is it possible that imaginative writers should be so fond of
    depreciating and lamenting over their own destiny? Possible,
    certainly&mdash;but reasonable, not at all&mdash;and grateful, less than
    anything!
</p>
<p>
    My faults, my faults&mdash;Shall I help you? Ah&mdash;you see them too well, I
    fear. And do you know that <i>I</i> also have something of your feeling
    about 'being about to <i>begin</i>,' or I should dare to praise you for
    having it. But in you, it is different&mdash;it is, in you, a virtue. When
    Prometheus had recounted a long list of sorrows to be endured by Io, and
    declared at last that he was <span title="mêdepô en prooimiois">&mu;&eta;&delta;&epsilon;&pi;&omega; &epsilon;&nu; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&omicron;&iota;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,<b><a href="#note-2">2</a></b>
    poor Io burst out crying. And when the author of 'Paracelsus' and the
    'Bells and Pomegranates' says that he is only 'going to begin' we may
    well (to take 'the opposite idea,' as you write) rejoice and clap our
    hands. Yet I believe that, whatever you may have done, you <i>will</i> do
    what is greater. It is my faith for you.
</p>
<p>
    And how I should like to know what poets have been your sponsors, 'to
    promise and vow' for you,&mdash;and whether you have held true to early
    tastes, or leapt violently from them, and what books you read, and
    what hours you write in. How curious I could prove myself!&mdash;(if it
    isn't proved already).
</p>
<p>
    But this is too much indeed, past all bearing, I suspect. Well, but if
    I ever write to you again&mdash;I mean, if you wish it&mdash;it may be in the
    other extreme of shortness. So do not take me for a born heroine of
    Richardson, or think that I sin always to this length, else,&mdash;you
    might indeed repent your quotation from Juliet&mdash;which I guessed at
    once&mdash;and of course&mdash;

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Hatcham, Tuesday.<br>
 [Post-mark, February 11, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;People would hardly ever tell falsehoods about a
    matter, if they had been let tell truth in the beginning, for it is
    hard to prophane one's very self, and nobody who has, for instance,
    used certain words and ways to a mother or a father <i>could</i>, even if
    by the devil's help he <i>would</i>, reproduce or mimic them with any
    effect to anybody else that was to be won over&mdash;and so, if 'I love
    you' were always outspoken when it might be, there would, I suppose,
    be no fear of its desecration at any after time. But lo! only last
    night, I had to write, on the part of Mr. Carlyle, to a certain
    ungainly, foolish gentleman who keeps back from him, with all the
    fussy impotence of stupidity (not bad feeling, alas! for <i>that</i> we
    could deal with) a certain MS. letter of Cromwell's which completes
    the collection now going to press; and this long-ears had to be 'dear
    Sir'd and obedient servanted' till I <i>said</i> (to use a mild word)
    'commend me to the sincerities of this kind of thing.'! When I spoke
    of you knowing little of me, one of the senses in which I meant so was
    this&mdash;that I would not well vowel-point my common-place letters and
    syllables with a masoretic <i>other</i> sound and sense, make my 'dear'
    something intenser than 'dears' in ordinary, and 'yours ever' a
    thought more significant than the run of its like. And all this came
    of your talking of 'tiring me,' 'being too envious,' &amp;c. &amp;c., which I
    should never have heard of had the plain truth looked out of my letter
    with its unmistakable eyes. <i>Now</i>, what you say of the 'bowing,' and
    convention that is to be, and <i>tant de façons</i> that are not to be,
    helps me once and for ever&mdash;for have I not a right to say simply that,
    for reasons I know, for other reasons I don't exactly know, but might
    if I chose to think a little, and for still other reasons, which, most
    likely, all the choosing and thinking in the world would not make me
    know, I had rather hear from you than see anybody else. Never you
    care, dear noble Carlyle, nor you, my own friend Alfred over the sea,
    nor a troop of true lovers!&mdash;Are not their fates written? there! Don't
    you answer this, please, but, mind it is on record, and now then, with
    a lighter conscience I shall begin replying to your questions. But
    then&mdash;what I have printed gives <i>no</i> knowledge of me&mdash;it evidences
    abilities of various kinds, if you will&mdash;and a dramatic sympathy with
    certain modifications of passion ... <i>that</i> I think&mdash;But I never have
    begun, even, what I hope I was born to begin and end&mdash;'R.B. a
    poem'&mdash;and next, if I speak (and, God knows, feel), as if what you
    have read were sadly imperfect demonstrations of even mere ability, it
    is from no absurd vanity, though it might seem so&mdash;these scenes and
    song-scraps <i>are</i> such mere and very escapes of my inner power, which
    lives in me like the light in those crazy Mediterranean phares I have
    watched at sea, wherein the light is ever revolving in a dark gallery,
    bright and alive, and only after a weary interval leaps out, for a
    moment, from the one narrow chink, and then goes on with the blind
    wall between it and you; and, no doubt, <i>then</i>, precisely, does the
    poor drudge that carries the cresset set himself most busily to trim
    the wick&mdash;for don't think I want to say I have not worked hard&mdash;(this
    head of mine knows better)&mdash;but the work has been <i>inside</i>, and not
    when at stated times I held up my light to you&mdash;and, that there is no
    self-delusion here, I would prove to you (and nobody else), even by
    opening this desk I write on, and showing what stuff, in the way of
    wood, I <i>could</i> make a great bonfire with, if I might only knock the
    whole clumsy top off my tower! Of course, every writing body says the
    same, so I gain nothing by the avowal; but when I remember how I have
    done what was published, and half done what may never be, I say with
    some right, you can know but little of me. Still, I <i>hope</i> sometimes,
    though phrenologists will have it that I <i>cannot</i>, and am doing
    better with this darling 'Luria'&mdash;so safe in my head, and a tiny slip
    of paper I cover with my thumb!
</p>
<p>
    Then you inquire about my 'sensitiveness to criticism,' and I shall be
    glad to tell you exactly, because I have, more than once, taken a
    course you might else not understand. I shall live always&mdash;that is for
    me&mdash;I am living here this 1845, that is for London. I write from a
    thorough conviction that it is the duty of me, and with the belief
    that, after every drawback and shortcoming, I do my best, all things
    considered&mdash;that is for <i>me</i>, and, so being, the not being listened to
    by one human creature would, I hope, in nowise affect me. But of
    course I must, if for merely scientific purposes, know all about this
    1845, its ways and doings, and something I do know, as that for a
    dozen cabbages, if I pleased to grow them in the garden here, I might
    demand, say, a dozen pence at Covent Garden Market,&mdash;and that for a
    dozen scenes, of the average goodness, I may challenge as many
    plaudits at the theatre close by; and a dozen pages of verse, brought
    to the Rialto where verse-merchants most do congregate, ought to bring
    me a fair proportion of the Reviewers' gold currency, seeing the other
    traders pouch their winnings, as I do see. Well, when they won't pay
    me for my cabbages, nor praise me for my poems, I may, if I please,
    say 'more's the shame,' and bid both parties 'decamp to the crows,' in
    Greek phrase, and <i>yet</i> go very lighthearted back to a garden-full of
    rose-trees, and a soul-full of comforts. If they had bought my greens
    I should have been able to buy the last number of <i>Punch</i>, and go
    through the toll-gate of Waterloo Bridge, and give the blind
    clarionet-player a trifle, and all without changing my gold. If they
    had taken to my books, my father and mother would have been proud of
    this and the other 'favourable critique,' and&mdash;at least so folks
    hold&mdash;I should have to pay Mr. Moxon less by a few pounds,
    whereas&mdash;but you see! Indeed I force myself to say ever and anon, in
    the interest of the market-gardeners regular, and Keatses proper,
    'It's nothing to <i>you</i>, critics, hucksters, all of you, if I <i>have</i>
    this garden and this conscience&mdash;I might go die at Rome, or take to
    gin and the newspaper, for what <i>you</i> would care!' So I don't quite
    lay open my resources to everybody. But it does so happen, that I have
    met with much more than I could have expected in this matter of kindly
    and prompt recognition. I never wanted a real set of good hearty
    praisers&mdash;and no bad reviewers&mdash;I am quite content with my share.
    No&mdash;what I laughed at in my 'gentle audience' is a sad trick the real
    admirers have of admiring at the wrong place&mdash;enough to make an
    apostle swear. <i>That</i> does make me savage&mdash;<i>never</i> the other kind of
    people; why, think now&mdash;take your own 'Drama of Exile' and let <i>me</i>
    send it to the first twenty men and women that shall knock at your
    door to-day and after&mdash;of whom the first five are the Postman, the
    seller of cheap sealing-wax, Mr. Hawkins Junr, the Butcher for orders,
    and the Tax-gatherer&mdash;will you let me, by Cornelius Agrippa's
    assistance, force these five and these fellows to read, and report on,
    this 'Drama'&mdash;and, when I have put these faithful reports into fair
    English, do you believe they would be better than, if as good, as, the
    general run of Periodical criticisms? Not they, I will venture to
    affirm. But then&mdash;once again, I get these people together and give
    them your book, and persuade them, moreover, that by praising it, the
    Postman will be helping its author to divide Long Acre into two beats,
    one of which she will take with half the salary and all the red
    collar,&mdash;that a sealing-wax vendor will see red wafers brought into
    vogue, and so on with the rest&mdash;and won't you just wish for your
    <i>Spectators</i> and <i>Observers</i> and Newcastle-upon-Tyne&mdash;Hebdomadal
    <i>Mercuries</i> back again! You see the inference&mdash;I do sincerely esteem
    it a perfectly providential and miraculous thing that they are so
    well-behaved in ordinary, these critics; and for Keats and Tennyson to
    'go softly all their days' for a gruff word or two is quite
    inexplicable to me, and always has been. Tennyson reads the
    <i>Quarterly</i> and does as they bid him, with the most solemn face in the
    world&mdash;out goes this, in goes that, all is changed and ranged. Oh me!

    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">50 Wimpole Street, February 17, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    Dear Mr. Browning,&mdash;To begin with the end (which is only
    characteristic of the perverse like myself), I assure you I read your
    handwriting as currently as I could read the clearest type from font.
    If I had practised the art of reading your letters all my life, I
    couldn't do it better. And then I approve of small MS. upon principle.
    Think of what an immense quantity of physical energy must go to the
    making of those immense sweeping handwritings achieved by some persons
    ... Mr. Landor, for instance, who writes as if he had the sky for a
    copybook and dotted his <i>i</i>'s in proportion. People who do such things
    should wear gauntlets; yes, and have none to wear; or they wouldn't
    waste their time so. People who write&mdash;by profession&mdash;shall I
    say?&mdash;never should do it, or what will become of them when most of
    their strength retires into their head and heart, (as is the case with
    some of us and may be the case with all) and when they have to write a
    poem twelve times over, as Mr. Kenyon says I should do if I were
    virtuous? Not that I do it. Does anybody do it, I wonder? Do <i>you</i>,
    ever? From what you tell me of the trimming of the light, I imagine
    not. And besides, one may be laborious as a writer, without copying
    twelve times over. I believe there are people who will tell you in a
    moment what three times six is, without 'doing it' on their fingers;
    and in the same way one may work one's verses in one's head quite as
    laboriously as on paper&mdash;I maintain it. I consider myself a very
    patient, laborious writer&mdash;though dear Mr. Kenyon laughs me to scorn
    when I say so. And just see how it could be otherwise. If I were
    netting a purse I might be thinking of something else and drop my
    stitches; or even if I were writing verses to please a popular taste,
    I might be careless in it. But the pursuit of an Ideal acknowledged by
    the mind, <i>will</i> draw and concentrate the powers of the mind&mdash;and Art,
    you know, is a jealous god and demands the whole man&mdash;or woman. I
    cannot conceive of a sincere artist who is also a careless one&mdash;though
    one may have a quicker hand than another, in general,&mdash;and though all
    are liable to vicissitudes in the degree of facility&mdash;and to
    entanglements in the machinery, notwithstanding every degree of
    facility. You may write twenty lines one day&mdash;or even three like
    Euripides in three days&mdash;and a hundred lines in one more day&mdash;and yet
    on the hundred, may have been expended as much good work, as on the
    twenty and the three. And also, as you say, the lamp is trimmed behind
    the wall&mdash;and the act of utterance is the evidence of foregone study
    still more than it is the occasion to study. The deep interest with
    which I read all that you had the kindness to write to me of yourself,
    you must trust me for, as I find it hard to express it. It is sympathy
    in one way, and interest every way! And now, see! Although you proved
    to me with admirable logic that, for reasons which you know and
    reasons which you don't know, I couldn't possibly know anything about
    you; though that is all true&mdash;and proven (which is better than
    true)&mdash;I really did understand of you before I was told, exactly what
    you told me. Yes, I did indeed. I felt sure that as a poet you fronted
    the future&mdash;and that your chief works, in your own apprehension, were
    to come. Oh&mdash;I take no credit of sagacity for it; as I did not long
    ago to my sisters and brothers, when I professed to have knowledge of
    all their friends whom I never saw in my life, by the image coming
    with the name; and threw them into shouts of laughter by giving out
    all the blue eyes and black eyes and hazel eyes and noses Roman and
    Gothic ticketed aright for the Mr. Smiths and Miss Hawkinses,&mdash;and hit
    the bull's eye and the true features of the case, ten times out of
    twelve! But <i>you</i> are different. <i>You</i> are to be made out by the
    comparative anatomy system. You have thrown out fragments of <i>os</i> ...
    <i>sublime</i> ... indicative of soul-mammothism&mdash;and you live to develop
    your nature,&mdash;<i>if</i> you live. That is easy and plain. You have taken a
    great range&mdash;from those high faint notes of the mystics which are
    beyond personality ... to dramatic impersonations, gruff with nature,
    'gr-r-r- you swine'; and when these are thrown into harmony, as in a
    manner they are in 'Pippa Passes' (which I could find in my heart to
    covet the authorship of, more than any of your works&mdash;), the
    combinations of effect must always be striking and noble&mdash;and you must
    feel yourself drawn on to such combinations more and more. But I do
    not, you say, know yourself&mdash;you. I only know abilities and faculties.
    Well, then, teach me yourself&mdash;you. I will not insist on the
    knowledge&mdash;and, in fact, you have not written the R.B. poem yet&mdash;your
    rays fall obliquely rather than directly straight. I see you only in
    your moon. Do tell me all of yourself that you can and will ... before
    the R.B. poem comes out. And what is 'Luria'? A poem and not a drama?
    I mean, a poem not in the dramatic form? Well! I have wondered at you
    sometimes, not for daring, but for bearing to trust your noble works
    into the great mill of the 'rank, popular' playhouse, to be ground to
    pieces between the teeth of vulgar actors and actresses. I, for one,
    would as soon have 'my soul among lions.' 'There is a fascination in
    it,' says Miss Mitford, and I am sure there must be, to account for
    it. Publics in the mass are bad enough; but to distil the dregs of the
    public and baptise oneself in that acrid moisture, where can be the
    temptation? I could swear by Shakespeare, as was once sworn 'by those
    dead at Marathon,' that I do not see where. I love the drama too. I
    look to our old dramatists as to our Kings and princes in poetry. I
    love them through all the deeps of their abominations. But the theatre
    in those days was a better medium between the people and the poet; and
    the press in those days was a less sufficient medium than now. Still,
    the poet suffered by the theatre even then; and the reasons are very
    obvious.
</p>
<p>
    How true&mdash;how true ... is all you say about critics. My convictions
    follow you in every word. And I delighted to read your views of the
    poet's right aspect towards criticism&mdash;I read them with the most
    complete appreciation and sympathy. I have sometimes thought that it
    would be a curious and instructive process, as illustrative of the
    wisdom and apprehensiveness of critics, if anyone would collect the
    critical soliloquies of every age touching its own literature, (as far
    as such may be extant) and <i>confer</i> them with the literary product of
    the said ages. Professor Wilson has begun something of the kind
    apparently, in his initiatory paper of the last <i>Blackwood</i> number on
    critics, beginning with Dryden&mdash;but he seems to have no design in his
    notice&mdash;it is a mere critique on the critic. And then, he should have
    begun earlier than Dryden&mdash;earlier even than Sir Philip Sydney, who in
    the noble 'Discourse on Poetry,' gives such singular evidence of being
    stone-critic-blind to the gods who moved around him. As far as I can
    remember, he saw even Shakespeare but indifferently. Oh, it was in his
    eyes quite an unillumed age, that period of Elizabeth which <i>we</i> see
    full of suns! and few can see what is close to the eyes though they
    run their heads against it; the denial of contemporary genius is the
    rule rather than the exception. No one counts the eagles in the nest,
    till there is a rush of wings; and lo! they are flown. And here we
    speak of understanding men, such as the Sydneys and the Drydens. Of
    the great body of critics you observe rightly, that they are better
    than might be expected of their badness, only the fact of their
    <i>influence</i> is no less undeniable than the reason why they should not
    be influential. The brazen kettles will be taken for oracles all the
    world over. But the influence is for to-day, for this hour&mdash;not for
    to-morrow and the day after&mdash;unless indeed, as you say, the poet do
    himself perpetuate the influence by submitting to it. Do you know
    Tennyson?&mdash;that is, with a face to face knowledge? I have great
    admiration for him. In execution, he is exquisite,&mdash;and, in music, a
    most subtle weigher out to the ear of fine airs. That such a poet
    should submit blindly to the suggestions of his critics, (I do not say
    that suggestions from without may not be accepted with discrimination
    sometimes, to the benefit of the acceptor), blindly and implicitly to
    the suggestions of his critics, is much as if Babbage were to take my
    opinion and undo his calculating machine by it. Napoleon called poetry
    <i>science creuse</i>&mdash;which, although he was not scientific in poetry
    himself, is true enough. But anybody is qualified, according to
    everybody, for giving opinions upon poetry. It is not so in chymistry
    and mathematics. Nor is it so, I believe, in whist and the polka. But
    then these are more serious things.
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;and it does delight me to hear of your garden full of roses and
    soul full of comforts! You have the right to both&mdash;you have the key to
    both. You have written enough to live by, though only beginning to
    write, as you say of yourself. And this reminds me to remind you that
    when I talked of coveting most the authorship of your 'Pippa,' I did
    not mean to call it your finest work (you might reproach me for
    <i>that</i>), but just to express a personal feeling. Do you know what it
    is to covet your neighbour's poetry?&mdash;not his fame, but his poetry?&mdash;I
    dare say not. You are too generous. And, in fact, beauty is beauty,
    and, whether it comes by our own hand or another's, blessed be the
    coming of it! <i>I</i>, besides, feel <i>that</i>. And yet&mdash;and yet, I have been
    aware of a feeling within me which has spoken two or three times to
    the effect of a wish, that I had been visited with the vision of
    'Pippa,' before you&mdash;and <i>confiteor tibi</i>&mdash;I confess the baseness of
    it. The conception is, to my mind, most exquisite and altogether
    original&mdash;and the contrast in the working out of the plan, singularly
    expressive of various faculty.
</p>
<p>
    Is the poem under your thumb, emerging from it? and in what metre? May
    I ask such questions?
</p>
<p>
    And does Mr. Carlyle tell you that he has forbidden all 'singing' to
    this perverse and froward generation, which should work and not sing?
    And have you told Mr. Carlyle that song is work, and also the
    condition of work? I am a devout sitter at his feet&mdash;and it is an
    effort to me to think him wrong in anything&mdash;and once when he told me
    to write prose and not verse, I fancied that his opinion was I had
    mistaken my calling,&mdash;a fancy which in infinite kindness and
    gentleness he stooped immediately to correct. I never shall forget the
    grace of that kindness&mdash;but then! For <i>him</i> to have thought ill of
    <i>me</i>, would not have been strange&mdash;I often think ill of myself, as God
    knows. But for Carlyle to think of putting away, even for a season,
    the poetry of the world, was wonderful, and has left me ruffled in my
    thoughts ever since. I do not know him personally at all. But as his
    disciple I ventured (by an exceptional motive) to send him my poems,
    and I heard from him as a consequence. 'Dear and noble' he is
    indeed&mdash;and a poet unaware of himself; all but the sense of music. You
    feel it so&mdash;do you not? And the 'dear sir' has let him have the
    'letter of Cromwell,' I hope; and satisfied 'the obedient servant.'
    The curious thing in this world is not the stupidity, but the
    upper-handism of the stupidity. The geese are in the Capitol, and the
    Romans in the farmyard&mdash;and it seems all quite natural that it should
    be so, both to geese and Romans!
</p>
<p>
    But there are things you say, which seem to me supernatural, for
    reasons which I know and for reasons which I don't know. You will let
    me be grateful to you,&mdash;will you not? You must, if you will or not.
    And also&mdash;I would not wait for more leave&mdash;if I could but see your
    desk&mdash;as I do your death's heads and the spider-webs appertaining; but
    the soul of Cornelius Agrippa fades from me.

</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday Morning&mdash;Spring!<br>
[Post-mark, February 26, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Real warm Spring, dear Miss Barrett, and the birds know it; and in
    Spring I shall see you, surely see you&mdash;for when did I once fail to
    get whatever I had set my heart upon? As I ask myself sometimes, with
    a strange fear.
</p>
<p>
    I took up this paper to write a great deal&mdash;now, I don't think I shall
    write much&mdash;'I shall see you,' I say!
</p>
<p>
    That 'Luria' you enquire about, shall be my last play&mdash;for it is but a
    play, woe's me! I have one done here, 'A Soul's Tragedy,' as it is
    properly enough called, but <i>that</i> would not do to end with (end I
    will), and Luria is a Moor, of Othello's country, and devotes himself
    to something he thinks Florence, and the old fortune follows&mdash;all in
    my brain yet, but the bright weather helps and I will soon loosen my
    Braccio and Puccio (a pale discontented man), and Tiburzio (the Pisan,
    good true fellow, this one), and Domizia the Lady&mdash;loosen all these on
    dear foolish (ravishing must his folly be), golden-hearted Luria, all
    these with their worldly-wisdom and Tuscan shrewd ways; and, for me,
    the misfortune is, I sympathise just as much with these as with
    him,&mdash;so there can no good come of keeping this wild company any
    longer, and 'Luria' and the other sadder ruin of one Chiappino&mdash;these
    got rid of, I will do as you bid me, and&mdash;say first I have some
    Romances and Lyrics, all dramatic, to dispatch, and <i>then</i>, I shall
    stoop of a sudden under and out of this dancing ring of men and women
    hand in hand, and stand still awhile, should my eyes dazzle, and when
    that's over, they will be gone and you will be there, <i>pas vrai</i>? For,
    as I think I told you, I always shiver involuntarily when I look&mdash;no,
    glance&mdash;at this First Poem of mine to be. '<i>Now</i>,' I call it, what,
    upon my soul,&mdash;for a solemn matter it is,&mdash;what is to be done <i>now</i>,
    believed <i>now</i>, so far as it has been revealed to me&mdash;solemn words,
    truly&mdash;and to find myself writing them to any one else! Enough now.
</p>
<p>
    I know Tennyson 'face to face,'&mdash;no more than that. I know Carlyle and
    love him&mdash;know him so well, that I would have told you he had shaken
    that grand head of his at 'singing,' so thoroughly does he love and
    live by it. When I last saw him, a fortnight ago, he turned, from I
    don't know what other talk, quite abruptly on me with, 'Did you never
    try to write a <i>Song</i>? Of all things in the world, <i>that</i> I should be
    proudest to do.' Then came his definition of a song&mdash;then, with an
    appealing look to Mrs. C., 'I always say that some day in <i>spite of
    nature and my stars</i>, I shall burst into a song' (he is not
    mechanically 'musical,' he meant, and the music is the poetry, he
    holds, and should enwrap the thought as Donne says 'an amber-drop
    enwraps a bee'), and then he began to recite an old Scotch song,
    stopping at the first rude couplet, 'The beginning words are merely to
    set the tune, they tell me'&mdash;and then again at the couplet about&mdash;or,
    to the effect that&mdash;'give me' (but in broad Scotch) 'give me but my
    lass, I care not for my cogie.' '<i>He says</i>,' quoth Carlyle
    magisterially, 'that if you allow him the love of his lass, you may
    take away all else, even his cogie, his cup or can, and he cares not,'
    just as a professor expounds Lycophron. And just before I left
    England, six months ago, did not I hear him croon, if not certainly
    sing, 'Charlie is my darling' ('my <i>darling</i>' with an adoring
    emphasis), and then he stood back, as it were, from the song, to look
    at it better, and said 'How must that notion of ideal wondrous
    perfection have impressed itself in this old Jacobite's "young
    Cavalier"&mdash;("They go to save their land, and the <i>young
    Cavalier</i>!!")&mdash;when I who care nothing about such a rag of a man,
    cannot but feel as he felt, in speaking his words after him!' After
    saying which, he would be sure to counsel everybody to get their heads
    clear of all singing! Don't let me forget to clap hands, we got the
    letter, dearly bought as it was by the 'Dear Sirs,' &amp;c., and
    insignificant scrap as it proved, but still it is got, to my
    encouragement in diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
    Who told you of my sculls and spider webs&mdash;Horne? Last year I petted
    extraordinarily a fine fellow, (a <i>garden</i> spider&mdash;there was the
    singularity,&mdash;the thin clever-even-for-a-spider-sort, and they are
    <i>so</i> 'spirited and sly,' all of them&mdash;this kind makes a long cone of
    web, with a square chamber of vantage at the end, and there he sits
    loosely and looks about), a great fellow that housed himself, with
    real gusto, in the jaws of a great scull, whence he watched me as I
    wrote, and I remember speaking to Horne about his good points.
    Phrenologists look gravely at that great scull, by the way, and hope,
    in their grim manner, that its owner made a good end. He looks
    quietly, now, out at the green little hill behind. I have no little
    insight to the feelings of furniture, and treat books and prints with
    a reasonable consideration. How some people use their pictures, for
    instance, is a mystery to me; very revolting all the same&mdash;portraits
    obliged to face each other for ever,&mdash;prints put together in
    portfolios. My Polidoro's perfect Andromeda along with 'Boors
    Carousing,' by Ostade,&mdash;where I found her,&mdash;my own father's doing, or
    I would say more.
</p>
<p>
    And when I have said I like 'Pippa' better than anything else I have
    done yet, I shall have answered all you bade me. And now may <i>I</i>
    begin questioning? No,&mdash;for it is all a pure delight to me, so that
    you do but write. I never was without good, kind, generous friends and
    lovers, so they say&mdash;so they were and are,&mdash;perhaps they came at the
    wrong time&mdash;I never wanted them&mdash;though that makes no difference in my
    gratitude I trust,&mdash;but I know myself&mdash;surely&mdash;and always have done
    so, for is there not somewhere the little book I first printed when a
    boy, with John Mill, the metaphysical head, <i>his</i> marginal note that
    'the writer possesses a deeper self-consciousness than I ever knew in
    a sane human being.' So I never deceived myself much, nor called my
    feelings for people other than they were. And who has a right to say,
    if I have not, that I had, but I said that, supernatural or no. Pray
    tell me, too, of your present doings and projects, and never write
    yourself 'grateful' to me, who <i>am</i> grateful, very grateful to
    you,&mdash;for none of your words but I take in earnest&mdash;and tell me if
    Spring <i>be not</i> coming, come, and I will take to writing the gravest
    of letters, because this beginning is for gladness' sake, like
    Carlyle's song couplet. My head aches a little to-day too, and, as
    poor dear Kirke White said to the moon, from his heap of mathematical
    papers,
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">'I throw aside the learned sheet;<br>

</p>
<p>
    Yes, but, dear Mr. Browning, I want the spring according to the new
    'style' (mine), and not the old one of you and the rest of the poets.
    To me unhappily, the snowdrop is much the same as the snow&mdash;it feels
    as cold underfoot&mdash;and I have grown sceptical about 'the voice of the
    turtle,' the east winds blow so loud. April is a Parthian with a dart,
    and May (at least the early part of it) a spy in the camp. <i>That</i> is
    my idea of what you call spring; mine, in the <i>new style</i>! A little
    later comes my spring; and indeed after such severe weather, from
    which I have just escaped with my life, I may thank it for coming at
    all. How happy you are, to be able to listen to the 'birds' without
    the commentary of the east wind, which, like other commentaries,
    spoils the music. And how happy I am to listen to you, when you write
    such kind open-hearted letters to me! I am delighted to hear all you
    say to me of yourself, and 'Luria,' and the spider, and to do him no
    dishonour in the association, of the great teacher of the age,
    Carlyle, who is also yours and mine. He fills the office of a
    poet&mdash;does he not?&mdash;by analysing humanity back into its elements, to
    the destruction of the conventions of the hour. That is&mdash;strictly
    speaking&mdash;the office of the poet, is it not?&mdash;and he discharges it
    fully, and with a wider intelligibility perhaps as far as the
    contemporary period is concerned, than if he did forthwith 'burst into
    a song.'
</p>
<p>
    But how I do wander!&mdash;I meant to say, and I will call myself back to
    say, that spring will really come some day I hope and believe, and the
    warm settled weather with it, and that then I shall be probably fitter
    for certain pleasures than I can appear even to myself now.
</p>
<p>
    And, in the meantime, I seem to see 'Luria' instead of you; I have
    visions and dream dreams. And the 'Soul's Tragedy,' which sounds to me
    like the step of a ghost of an old Drama! and you are not to think
    that I blaspheme the Drama, dear Mr. Browning; or that I ever thought
    of exhorting you to give up the 'solemn robes' and tread of the
    buskin. It is the theatre which vulgarises these things; the modern
    theatre in which we see no altar! where the thymelé is replaced by the
    caprice of a popular actor. And also, I have a fancy that your great
    dramatic power would work more clearly and audibly in the less
    definite mould&mdash;but you ride your own faculty as Oceanus did his
    sea-horse, 'directing it by your will'; and woe to the impertinence,
    which would dare to say 'turn this way' or 'turn from that way'&mdash;it
    should not be <i>my</i> impertinence. Do not think I blaspheme the Drama. I
    have gone through 'all such reading as should never be read' (that is,
    by women!), through my love of it on the contrary. And the dramatic
    faculty is strong in you&mdash;and therefore, as 'I speak unto a wise man,
    judge what I say.'
</p>
<p>
    For myself and my own doings, you shall hear directly what I have been
    doing, and what I am about to do. Some years ago, as perhaps you may
    have heard, (but I hope not, for the fewer who hear of it the
    better)&mdash;some years ago, I translated or rather <i>undid</i> into English,
    the 'Prometheus' of Æschylus. To speak of this production moderately
    (not modestly), it is the most miserable of all miserable versions of
    the class. It was completed (in the first place) in thirteen days&mdash;the
    iambics thrown into blank verse, the lyrics into rhymed octosyllabics
    and the like,&mdash;and the whole together as cold as Caucasus, and as flat
    as the nearest plain. To account for this, the haste may be something;
    but if my mind had been properly awakened at the time, I might have
    made still more haste and done it better. Well,&mdash;the comfort is, that
    the little book was unadvertised and unknown, and that most of the
    copies (through my entreaty of my father) are shut up in the wardrobe
    of his bedroom. If ever I get well I shall show my joy by making a
    bonfire of them. In the meantime, the recollection of this sin of mine
    has been my nightmare and daymare too, and the sin has been the 'Blot
    on my escutcheon.' I could look in nobody's face, with a 'Thou canst
    not say I did it'&mdash;I know, I did it. And so I resolved to wash away
    the transgression, and translate the tragedy over again. It was an
    honest straightforward proof of repentance&mdash;was it not? and I have
    completed it, except the transcription and last polishing. If
    Æschylus stands at the foot of my bed now, I shall have a little
    breath to front him. I have done my duty by him, not indeed according
    to his claims, but in proportion to my faculty. Whether I shall ever
    publish or not (remember) remains to be considered&mdash;that is a
    different side of the subject. If I do, it <i>may</i> be in a
    magazine&mdash;or&mdash;but this is another ground. And then, I have in my head
    to associate with the version, a monodrama of my own,&mdash;not a long
    poem, but a monologue of Æschylus as he sate a blind exile on the
    flats of Sicily and recounted the past to his own soul, just before
    the eagle cracked his great massy skull with a stone.
</p>
<p>
    But my chief <i>intention</i> just now is the writing of a sort of
    novel-poem&mdash;a poem as completely modern as 'Geraldine's Courtship,'
    running into the midst of our conventions, and rushing into
    drawing-rooms and the like, 'where angels fear to tread'; and so,
    meeting face to face and without mask the Humanity of the age, and
    speaking the truth as I conceive of it out plainly. That is my
    intention. It is not mature enough yet to be called a plan. I am
    waiting for a story, and I won't take one, because I want to make one,
    and I like to make my own stories, because then I can take liberties
    with them in the treatment.
</p>
<p>
    Who told me of your skulls and spiders? Why, couldn't I know it
    without being told? Did Cornelius Agrippa know nothing without being
    told? Mr. Horne never spoke it to my ears&mdash;(I never saw him face to
    face in my life, although we have corresponded for long and long), and
    he never wrote it to my eyes. Perhaps he does not know that I know it.
    Well, then! if I were to say that <i>I heard it from you yourself</i>, how
    would you answer? <i>And it was so.</i> Why, are you not aware that these
    are the days of mesmerism and clairvoyance? Are you an infidel? I have
    believed in your skulls for the last year, for my part.
</p>
<p>
    And I have some sympathy in your habit of feeling for chairs and
    tables. I remember, when I was a child and wrote poems in little
    clasped books, I used to kiss the books and put them away tenderly
    because I had been happy near them, and take them out by turns when I
    was going from home, to cheer them by the change of air and the
    pleasure of the new place. This, not for the sake of the verses
    written in them, and not for the sake of writing more verses in them,
    but from pure gratitude. Other books I used to treat in a like
    manner&mdash;and to talk to the trees and the flowers, was a natural
    inclination&mdash;but between me and that time, the cypresses grow thick
    and dark.
</p>
<p>
    Is it true that your wishes fulfil themselves? And when they <i>do</i>, are
    they not bitter to your taste&mdash;do you not wish them <i>un</i>fulfilled? Oh,
    this life, this life! There is comfort in it, they say, and I almost
    believe&mdash;but the brightest place in the house, is the leaning out of
    the window&mdash;at least, for me.
</p>
<p>
    Of course you are <i>self-conscious</i>&mdash;How could you be a poet otherwise?
    Tell me.

<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Night, March 1 [1845].
</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss Barrett,&mdash;I seem to find of a sudden&mdash;surely I knew
    before&mdash;anyhow, I <i>do</i> find now, that with the octaves on octaves of
    quite new golden strings you enlarged the compass of my life's harp
    with, there is added, too, such a tragic chord, that which you
    touched, so gently, in the beginning of your letter I got this
    morning, 'just escaping' &amp;c. But if my truest heart's wishes avail, as
    they have hitherto done, you shall laugh at East winds yet, as I do!
    See now, this sad feeling is so strange to me, that I must write it
    out, <i>must</i>, and you might give me great, the greatest pleasure for
    years and yet find me as passive as a stone used to wine libations,
    and as ready in expressing my sense of them, but when I am pained, I
    find the old theory of the uselessness of communicating the
    circumstances of it, singularly untenable. I have been 'spoiled' in
    this world&mdash;to such an extent, indeed, that I often <i>reason</i> out&mdash;make
    clear to myself&mdash;that I might very properly, so far as myself am
    concerned, take any step that would peril the whole of my future
    happiness&mdash;because the past is gained, secure, and on record; and,
    though not another of the old days should dawn on me, I shall not have
    lost my life, no! Out of all which you are&mdash;please&mdash;to make a sort of
    sense, if you can, so as to express that I have been deeply struck to
    find a new real unmistakable sorrow along with these as real but not
    so new joys you have given me. How strangely this connects itself in
    my mind with another subject in your note! I looked at that
    translation for a minute, not longer, years ago, knowing nothing about
    it or you, and I <i>only</i> looked to see what rendering a passage had
    received that was often in my thoughts.<a href="#note-3"><b><u>3</u></b></a> I forget your version (it
    was not <i>yours</i>, my <i>'yours' then</i>; I mean I had no extraordinary
    interest about it), but the original makes Prometheus (telling over
    his bestowments towards human happiness) say, as something <span title="peraiterô tônde">&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omega; &tau;&omega;&nu;&delta;&epsilon;</span>,
    that he stopped mortals <span title="mê proderkesthai moron--to poion eurôn">&mu;&eta; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&kappa;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota; &mu;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&mdash;&tau;&omicron; &pi;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&omega;&nu;</span>, asks the Chorus,
    <span title="têsde pharmakon nosou">&tau;&eta;&sigma;&delta;&epsilon; &phi;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&nu; &nu;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>?

    (what you hear men dissertate upon by the hour, as proving
    the immortality of the soul apart from revelation, undying yearnings,
    restless longings, instinctive desires which, unless to be eventually
    indulged, it were cruel to plant in us, &amp;c. &amp;c.). But,

    from the admitted Eleusinian Æschylus was! You cannot think how this
    foolish circumstance struck me this evening, so I thought I would e'en
    tell you at once and be done with it. Are you not my dear friend
    already, and shall I not use you? And pray you not to 'lean out of the

<p>
    But I did not mean to strike a 'tragic chord'; indeed I did not!
    Sometimes one's melancholy will be uppermost and sometimes one's
    mirth,&mdash;the world goes round, you know&mdash;and I suppose that in that
    letter of mine the melancholy took the turn. As to 'escaping with my
    life,' it was just a phrase&mdash;at least it did not signify more than
    that the sense of mortality, and discomfort of it, is peculiarly
    strong with me when east winds are blowing and waters freezing. For
    the rest, I am <i>essentially better</i>, and have been for several
    winters; and I feel as if it were intended for me to live and not die,
    and I am reconciled to the feeling. Yes! I am satisfied to 'take up'
    with the blind hopes again, and have them in the house with me, for
    all that I sit by the window. By the way, did the chorus utter scorn
    in the <span title="meg' ôphelêma">&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;' &omega;&phi;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span>. I think not. It is well to fly towards
    the light, even where there may be some fluttering and bruising of
    wings against the windowpanes, is it not?
</p>
<p>
    There is an obscurer passage, on which I covet your thoughts, where
    Prometheus, after the sublime declaration that, with a full knowledge
    of the penalty reserved for him, he had sinned of free will and
    choice&mdash;goes on to say&mdash;or to seem to say&mdash;that he had <i>not</i>, however,
    foreseen the extent and detail of the torment, the skiey rocks, and
    the friendless desolation. See v. 275. The intention of the poet
    might have been to magnify to his audience the torment of the
    martyrdom&mdash;but the heroism of the martyr diminishes in proportion&mdash;and
    there appears to be a contradiction, and oversight. Or is my view
    wrong? Tell me. And tell me too, if Æschylus not the divinest of all
    the divine Greek souls? People say after Quintilian, that he is savage
    and rude; a sort of poetic Orson, with his locks all wild. But I will
    not hear it of my master! He is strong as Zeus is&mdash;and not as a
    boxer&mdash;and tender as Power itself, which always is tenderest.
</p>
<p>
    But to go back to the view of Life with the blind Hopes; you are not
    to think&mdash;whatever I may have written or implied&mdash;that I lean either
    to the philosophy or affectation which beholds the world through
    darkness instead of light, and speaks of it wailingly. Now, may God
    forbid that it should be so with me. I am not desponding by nature,
    and after a course of bitter mental discipline and long bodily
    seclusion, I come out with two learnt lessons (as I sometimes say and
    oftener feel),&mdash;the wisdom of cheerfulness&mdash;and the duty of social
    intercourse. Anguish has instructed me in joy, and solitude in
    society; it has been a wholesome and not unnatural reaction. And
    altogether, I may say that the earth looks the brighter to me in
    proportion to my own deprivations. The laburnum trees and rose trees
    are plucked up by the roots&mdash;but the sunshine is in their places, and
    the root of the sunshine is above the storms. What we call Life is a
    condition of the soul, and the soul must improve in happiness and
    wisdom, except by its own fault. These tears in our eyes, these
    faintings of the flesh, will not hinder such improvement.
</p>
<p>
    And I do like to hear testimonies like yours, to <i>happiness</i>, and I
    feel it to be a testimony of a higher sort than the obvious one.
    Still, it is obvious too that you have been spared, up to this time,
    the great natural afflictions, against which we are nearly all called,
    sooner or later, to struggle and wrestle&mdash;or your step would not be
    'on the stair' quite so lightly. And so, we turn to you, dear Mr.
    Browning, for comfort and gentle spiriting! Remember that as you owe
    your unscathed joy to God, you should pay it back to His world. And I
    thank you for some of it already.
</p>
<p>
    Also, writing as from friend to friend&mdash;as you say rightly that we
    are&mdash;I ought to confess that of one class of griefs (which has been
    called too the bitterest), I know as little as you. The cruelty of the
    world, and the treason of it&mdash;the unworthiness of the dearest; of
    these griefs I have scanty knowledge. It seems to me from my personal
    experience that there is kindness everywhere in different proportions,
    and more goodness and tenderheartedness than we read of in the
    moralists. People have been kind to <i>me</i>, even without understanding
    me, and pitiful to me, without approving of me:&mdash;nay, have not the
    very critics tamed their beardom for me, and roared delicately as
    sucking doves, on behalf of me? I have no harm to say of your world,
    though I am not of it, as you see. And I have the cream of it in your
    friendship, and a little more, and I do not envy much the milkers of
    the cows.
</p>
<p>
    How kind you are!&mdash;how kindly and gently you speak to me! Some things
    you say are very touching, and some, surprising; and although I am
    aware that you unconsciously exaggerate what I can be to you, yet it
    is delightful to be broad awake and think of you as my friend.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you!

</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Morning.<br>
 [Post-mark, March 12, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Your letter made me so happy, dear Miss Barrett, that I have kept
    quiet this while; is it too great a shame if I begin to want more
    good news of you, and to say so? Because there has been a bitter wind
    ever since. Will you grant me a great favour? Always when you write,
    though about your own works, not Greek plays merely, put me in,
    <i>always</i>, a little official bulletin-line that shall say 'I am better'
    or 'still better,' will you? That is done, then&mdash;and now, what do I
    wish to tell you first? The poem you propose to make, for the times;
    the fearless fresh living work you describe, is the <i>only</i> Poem to be
    undertaken now by you or anyone that <i>is</i> a Poet at all; the only
    reality, only effective piece of service to be rendered God and man;
    it is what I have been all my life intending to do, and now shall be
    much, much nearer doing, since you will along with me. And you <i>can</i>
    do it, I know and am sure&mdash;so sure, that I could find in my heart to
    be jealous of your stopping in the way even to translate the
    Prometheus; though the accompanying monologue will make amends too. Or
    shall I set you a task I meant for myself once upon a time?&mdash;which,
    oh, how you would fulfil! Restore the Prometheus <span title="purphoros">&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> as
    Shelley did the <span title="Lyomenos">&Lambda;&upsilon;&omicron;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>; when I say 'restore,' I know, or
    very much fear, that the <span title="purphoros">&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> was the same with the
    <span title="purkaeus">&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&kappa;&alpha;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span> which, by a fragment, we sorrowfully ascertain to
    have been a Satyric Drama; but surely the capabilities of the subject
    are much greater than in this, we now wonder at; nay, they include all
    those of this last&mdash;for just see how magnificently the story unrolls
    itself. The beginning of Jupiter's dynasty, the calm in Heaven after
    the storm, the ascending&mdash;(stop, I will get the book and give the
    words), <span title="opôs tachista ton patrôon eis thronon kathezet', euthus daimosin nemei gera alloisin alla--k.t.l.">&omicron;&pi;&omega;&sigmaf; &tau;&alpha;&chi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha; &tau;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&omega;&omicron;&nu; &epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; &theta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&zeta;&epsilon;&tau;', &epsilon;&upsilon;&theta;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&iota;&nu; &nu;&epsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&iota; &gamma;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha; &alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&nu; &alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&mdash;&kappa;.&tau;.&lambda;.</span>,<u><b><a href="#note-4">4</a></b></u> all the while

    from the benign circle of grateful gods, and the dissuasion of old

    about to draw on himself, manifest itself more and more distinctly,
    till at the last, he shall achieve the salvation of man, body (by the
    gift of fire) and soul (by even those <span title="tuphlai elpides">&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&lambda;&alpha;&iota; &epsilon;&lambda;&pi;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,<u><b><a href="#note-10">10</a></b></u>
    hopes of immortality), and so having rendered him utterly, according
    to the mythos here, <i>independent</i> of Jove&mdash;for observe, Prometheus in
    the play never talks of helping mortals more, of fearing for them
    more, of even benefiting them more by his sufferings. The rest is
    between Jove and himself; he will reveal the master-secret to Jove
    when he shall have released him, &amp;c. There is no stipulation that the
    gifts to mortals shall be continued; indeed, by the fact that it is
    Prometheus who hangs on Caucasus while 'the ephemerals possess fire,'
    one sees that somehow mysteriously <i>they</i> are past Jove's harming now.
    Well, this wholly achieved, the price is as wholly accepted, and off
    into the darkness passes in calm triumphant grandeur the Titan, with
    Strength and Violence, and Vulcan's silent and downcast eyes, and then
    the gold clouds and renewed flushings of felicity shut up the scene
    again, with Might in his old throne again, yet with a new element of
    mistrust, and conscious shame, and fear, that writes significantly
    enough above all the glory and rejoicing that all is not as it was,
    nor will ever be. Such might be the framework of your Drama, just what
    cannot help striking one at first glance, and would not such a Drama
    go well before your translation? Do think of this and tell me&mdash;it
    nearly writes itself. You see, I meant the <span title="meg' ôphelêma">&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;' &omega;&phi;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&alpha;</span><u><b><a href="#note-11">11</a></b></u>
    to be a deep great truth; if there were no life beyond this, I think
    the hope in one would be an incalculable blessing <i>for</i> this life,
    which is melancholy for one like Æschylus to feel, if he could <i>only</i>
    hope, because the argument as to the ulterior good of those hopes is
    cut clean away, and what had he left?
</p>
<p>
    I do not find it take away from my feeling of the magnanimity of
    Prometheus that he should, in truth, complain (as he does from
    beginning to end) of what he finds himself suffering. He could have
    prevented all, and can stop it now&mdash;of that he never thinks for a
    moment. That was the old Greek way&mdash;they never let an antagonistic
    passion neutralise the other which was to influence the man to his
    praise or blame. A Greek hero fears exceedingly and battles it out,
    cries out when he is wounded and fights on, does not say his love or
    hate makes him see no danger or feel no pain. Æschylus from first word
    to last (<span title="idesthe me, oia paschô">&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&epsilon; &mu;&epsilon;, &omicron;&iota;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&sigma;&chi;&omega;</span><b><a href="#note-12">12</a></b>
    to <span title="esoras me, hôs ekdika paschô">
    &epsilon;&sigma;&omicron;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; &mu;&epsilon;, &omega;&sigmaf;

&epsilon;&kappa;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&sigma;&chi;&omega;</span><b><a href="#note-13">13</a></b>) insists on the unmitigated reality of the
    punishment which only the sun, and divine ether, and the godhead of
    his mother can comprehend; still, still that is only what I suppose
    Æschylus to have done&mdash;in your poem you shall make Prometheus our way.
</p>
<p>
    And now enough of Greek, which I am fast forgetting (for I never look
    at books I loved once)&mdash;it was your mention of the translation that
    brought out the old fast fading outlines of the Poem in my brain&mdash;the
    Greek poem, that is. You think&mdash;for I must get to <i>you</i>&mdash;that I
    'unconsciously exaggerate what you are to me.' Now, you don't know
    what <i>that</i> is, nor can I very well tell you, because the language
    with which I talk to myself of these matters is spiritual Attic, and
    'loves contractions,' as grammarians say; but I read it myself, and
    well know what it means, that's why I told you I was self-conscious&mdash;I
    meant that I never yet mistook my own feelings, one for
    another&mdash;there! Of what use is talking? Only do you stay here with me
    in the 'House' these few short years. Do you think I shall see you in
    two months, three months? I may travel, perhaps. So you have got to
    like society, and would enjoy it, you think? For me, I always hated
    it&mdash;have put up with it these six or seven years past, lest by
    foregoing it I should let some unknown good escape me, in the true
    time of it, and only discover my fault when too late; and now that I
    have done most of what is to be done, <i>any</i> lodge in a garden of
    cucumbers for me! I don't even care about reading now&mdash;the world, and
    pictures of it, rather than writings about the world! But you must
    read books in order to get words and forms for 'the public' if you
    <i>write</i>, and <i>that</i> you needs must do, if you fear God. I have no
    pleasure in writing myself&mdash;none, in the mere act&mdash;though all pleasure
    in the sense of fulfilling a duty, whence, if I have done my real
    best, judge how heart-breaking a matter must it be to be pronounced a
    poor creature by critic this and acquaintance the other! But I think
    you like the operation of writing as I should like that of painting or
    making music, do you not? After all, there is a great delight in the
    heart of the thing; and use and forethought have made me ready at all
    times to set to work&mdash;but&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;my heart sinks whenever I
    open this desk, and rises when I shut it. Yet but for what I have
    written you would never have heard of me&mdash;and <i>through</i> what you have
    written, not properly <i>for</i> it, I love and wish you well! Now, will
    you remember what I began my letter by saying&mdash;how you have promised
    to let me know if my wishing takes effect, and if you still continue
    better? And not even ... (since we are learned in magnanimity) don't
    even tell me that or anything else, if it teases you,&mdash;but wait your
    own good time, and know me for ... if these words were but my own, and
    fresh-minted for this moment's use!...

    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">50 Wimpole Street: March 20, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever I delay to write to you, dear Mr. Browning, it is not, be
    sure, that I take my 'own good time,' but submit to my own bad time.
    It was kind of you to wish to know how I was, and not unkind of me to
    suspend my answer to your question&mdash;for indeed I have not been very
    well, nor have had much heart for saying so. This implacable weather!
    this east wind that seems to blow through the sun and moon! who can be
    well in such a wind? Yet for me, I should not grumble. There has been
    nothing very bad the matter with me, as there used to be&mdash;I only grow
    weaker than usual, and learn my lesson of being mortal, in a
    corner&mdash;and then all this must end! April is coming. There will be
    both a May and a June if we live to see such things, and perhaps,
    after all, we may. And as to seeing <i>you</i> besides, I observe that you
    distrust me, and that perhaps you penetrate my morbidity and guess how
    when the moment comes to see a living human face to which I am not
    accustomed, I shrink and grow pale in the spirit. Do you? You are
    learned in human nature, and you know the consequences of leading such
    a secluded life as mine&mdash;notwithstanding all my fine philosophy about
    social duties and the like&mdash;well&mdash;if you have such knowledge or if you
    have it not, I cannot say, but I do say that I will indeed see you
    when the warm weather has revived me a little, and put the earth 'to
    rights' again so as to make pleasures of the sort possible. For if you
    think that I shall not <i>like</i> to see you, you are wrong, for all your
    learning. But I shall be afraid of you at first&mdash;though I am not, in
    writing thus. You are Paracelsus, and I am a recluse, with nerves that
    have been all broken on the rack, and now hang loosely&mdash;quivering at a
    step and breath.
</p>
<p>
    And what you say of society draws me on to many comparative thoughts
    of your life and mine. You seem to have drunken of the cup of life
    full, with the sun shining on it. I have lived only inwardly; or with
    <i>sorrow</i>, for a strong emotion. Before this seclusion of my illness, I
    was secluded still, and there are few of the youngest women in the
    world who have not seen more, heard more, known more, of society, than
    I, who am scarcely to be called young now. I grew up in the
    country&mdash;had no social opportunities, had my heart in books and
    poetry, and my experience in reveries. My sympathies drooped towards
    the ground like an untrained honeysuckle&mdash;and but for <i>one</i>, in my own
    house&mdash;but of this I cannot speak. It was a lonely life, growing green
    like the grass around it. Books and dreams were what I lived in&mdash;and
    domestic life only seemed to buzz gently around, like the bees about
    the grass. And so time passed, and passed&mdash;and afterwards, when my
    illness came and I seemed to stand at the edge of the world with all
    done, and no prospect (as appeared at one time) of ever passing the
    threshold of one room again; why then, I turned to thinking with some
    bitterness (after the greatest sorrow of my life had given me room and
    time to breathe) that I had stood blind in this temple I was about to
    leave&mdash;that I had seen no Human nature, that my brothers and sisters
    of the earth were <i>names</i> to me, that I had beheld no great mountain
    or river, nothing in fact. I was as a man dying who had not read
    Shakespeare, and it was too late! do you understand? And do you also
    know what a disadvantage this ignorance is to my art? Why, if I live
    on and yet do not escape from this seclusion, do you not perceive that
    I labour under signal disadvantages&mdash;that I am, in a manner, as a
    <i>blind poet</i>? Certainly, there is a compensation to a degree. I have
    had much of the inner life, and from the habit of self-consciousness
    and self-analysis, I make great guesses at Human nature in the main.
    But how willingly I would as a poet exchange some of this lumbering,
    ponderous, helpless knowledge of books, for some experience of life
    and man, for some....
</p>
<p>
    But all grumbling is a vile thing. We should all thank God for our
    measures of life, and think them enough for each of us. I write so,
    that you may not mistake what I wrote before in relation to society,
    although you do not see from my point of view; and that you may
    understand what I mean fully when I say, that I have lived all my
    chief <i>joys</i>, and indeed nearly all emotions that go warmly by that
    name and relate to myself personally, in poetry and in poetry alone.
    Like to write? Of course, of course I do. I seem to live while I
    write&mdash;it is life, for me. Why, what is to live? Not to eat and drink
    and breathe,&mdash;but to feel the life in you down all the fibres of
    being, passionately and joyfully. And thus, one lives in composition
    surely&mdash;not always&mdash;but when the wheel goes round and the procession
    is uninterrupted. Is it not so with you? oh&mdash;it must be so. For the
    rest, there will be necessarily a reaction; and, in my own particular
    case, whenever I see a poem of mine in print, or even smoothly
    transcribed, the reaction is most painful. The pleasure, the sense of
    power, without which I could not write a line, is gone in a moment;
    and nothing remains but disappointment and humiliation. I never wrote
    a poem which you could not persuade me to tear to pieces if you took
    me at the right moment! I have a <i>seasonable</i> humility, I do assure
    you.
</p>
<p>
    How delightful to talk about oneself; but as you 'tempted me and I did
    eat,' I entreat your longsuffering of my sin, and ah! if you would
    but sin back so in turn! You and I seem to meet in a mild contrarious
    harmony ... as in the 'si no, si no' of an Italian duet. I want to see
    more of men, and you have seen too much, you say. I am in ignorance,
    and you, in satiety. 'You don't even care about reading now.' Is it
    possible? And I am as 'fresh' about reading, as ever I was&mdash;as long as
    I keep out of the shadow of the dictionaries and of theological
    controversies, and the like. Shall I whisper it to you under the
    memory of the last rose of last summer? <i>I am very fond of romances</i>;
    yes! and I read them not only as some wise people are known to do, for
    the sake of the eloquence here and the sentiment there, and the
    graphic intermixtures here and there, but for the story! just as
    little children would, sitting on their papa's knee. My childish love
    of a story never wore out with my love of plum cake, and now there is
    not a hole in it. I make it a rule, for the most part, to read all the
    romances that other people are kind enough to write&mdash;and woe to the
    miserable wight who tells me how the third volume endeth. Have you in
    you any surviving innocence of this sort? or do you call it idiocy? If
    you do, I will forgive you, only smiling to myself&mdash;I give you
    notice,&mdash;with a smile of superior pleasure! Mr. Chorley made me quite
    laugh the other day by recommending Mary Hewitt's 'Improvisatore,'
    with a sort of deprecating reference to the <i>descriptions</i> in the
    book, just as if I never read a novel&mdash;<i>I!</i> I wrote a confession back
    to him which made him shake his head perhaps, and now I confess to
    <i>you</i>, unprovoked. I am one who could have forgotten the plague,
    listening to Boccaccio's stories; and I am not ashamed of it. I do not
    even 'see the better part,' I am so silly.
</p>
<p>
    Ah! you tempt me with a grand vision of Prometheus! <i>I</i>, who have just
    escaped with my life, after treading Milton's ground, you would send
    me to Æschylus's. No, <i>I do not dare</i>. And besides ... I am inclined
    to think that we want new <i>forms</i>, as well as thoughts. The old gods
    are dethroned. Why should we go back to the antique moulds, classical
    moulds, as they are so improperly called? If it is a necessity of Art
    to do so, why then those critics are right who hold that Art is
    exhausted and the world too worn out for poetry. I do not, for my
    part, believe this: and I believe the so-called necessity of Art to be
    the mere feebleness of the artist. Let us all aspire rather to <i>Life</i>,
    and let the dead bury their dead. If we have but courage to face these
    conventions, to touch this low ground, we shall take strength from it
    instead of losing it; and of that, I am intimately persuaded. For
    there is poetry <i>everywhere</i>; the 'treasure' (see the old fable) lies
    all over the field. And then Christianity is a worthy <i>myth</i>, and
    poetically acceptable.
</p>
<p>
    I had much to say to you, or at least something, of the 'blind hopes'
    &amp;c., but am ashamed to take a step into a new sheet. If you mean 'to
    travel,' why, I shall have to miss you. Do you really mean it? How is
    the play going on? and the poem?
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you!

    When you read Don Quixote, my dear romance-reader, do you ever notice
    that flower of an incident of good fellowship where the friendly
    Squire of Him of the Moon, or the Looking glasses, (I forget which)
    passes to Sancho's dry lips, (all under a cork-tree one morning)&mdash;a
    plump wine-skin,&mdash;and do you admire dear brave Miguel's knowledge of
    thirsty nature when he tells you that the Drinker, having seriously
    considered for a space the Pleiads, or place where they should be,
    fell, as he slowly returned the shrivelled bottle to its donor, into a
    deep musing of an hour's length, or thereabouts, and then ... mark ...
    only <i>then</i>, fetching a profound sigh, broke silence with ... such a
    piece of praise as turns pale the labours in that way of Rabelais and
    the Teian (if he wasn't a Byzantine monk, alas!) and our Mr. Kenyon's
    stately self&mdash;(since my own especial poet <i>à moi</i>, that can do all
    with anybody, only 'sips like a fly,' she says, and so cares not to
    compete with these behemoths that drink up Jordan)&mdash;Well, then ...
    (oh, I must get quick to the sentence's end, and be brief as an
    oracle-explainer!)&mdash;the giver is you and the taker is I, and the
    letter is the wine, and the star-gazing is the reading the same, and
    the brown study is&mdash;how shall I deserve and be grateful enough to this
    new strange friend of my own, that has taken away my reproach among
    men, that have each and all their friend, so they say (... not that I
    believe all they say&mdash;they boast too soon sometimes, no doubt,&mdash;I once
    was shown a letter wherein the truth stumbled out after this fashion
    'Dere Smith,&mdash;I calls you "<i>dere</i>" ... because you are so in your

    grateful at all,&mdash;and the breaking silence is, and the praise is ...
    ah, there, enough of it! This sunny morning is as if I wished it for

</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Night.<br>
[Post-mark, April 16, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I heard of you, dear Miss Barrett, between a Polka and a Cellarius the
    other evening, of Mr. Kenyon&mdash;how this wind must hurt you! And
    yesterday I had occasion to go your way&mdash;past, that is, Wimpole
    Street, the end of it,&mdash;and, do you know, I did not seem to have leave
    from you to go down it yet, much less count number after number till I
    came to yours,&mdash;much least than less, look up when I did come there.
    So I went on to a viperine she-friend of mine who, I think, rather
    loves me she does so hate me, and we talked over the chances of
    certain other friends who were to be balloted for at the 'Athenæum'
    last night,&mdash;one of whom, it seems, was in a fright about it&mdash;'to such
    little purpose' said my friend&mdash;'for he is so inoffensive&mdash;now, if one
    were to style <i>you</i> that&mdash;' 'Or you'&mdash;I said&mdash;and so we hugged
    ourselves in our grimness like tiger-cats. Then there is a deal in the
    papers to-day about Maynooth, and a meeting presided over by Lord
    Mayor Gibbs, and the Reverend Mr. Somebody's speech. And Mrs. Norton
    has gone and book-made at a great rate about the Prince of Wales,
    pleasantly putting off till his time all that used of old to be put
    off till his mother's time;&mdash;altogether, I should dearly like to hear
    from you, but not till the wind goes, and sun comes&mdash;because I shall
    see Mr. Kenyon next week and get him to tell me some more. By the way,
    do you suppose anybody else looks like him? If you do, the first room
    full of real London people you go among you will fancy to be lighted
    up by a saucer of burning salt and spirits of wine in the back ground.
</p>
<p>
    Monday&mdash;last night when I could do nothing else I began to write to
    you, such writing as you have seen&mdash;strange! The proper time and
    season for good sound sensible and profitable forms of speech&mdash;when
    ought it to have occurred, and how did I evade it in these letters of
    mine? For people begin with a graceful skittish levity, lest you
    should be struck all of a heap with what is to come, and <i>that</i> is
    sure to be the stuff and staple of the man, full of wisdom and
    sorrow,&mdash;and then again comes the fringe of reeds and pink little
    stones on the other side, that you may put foot on land, and draw
    breath, and think what a deep pond you have swum across. But <i>you</i> are
    the real deep wonder of a creature,&mdash;and I sail these paper-boats on
    you rather impudently. But I always mean to be very grave one
    day,&mdash;when I am in better spirits and can go <i>fuori di me</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And one thing I want to persuade you of, which is, that all you gain
    by travel is the discovery that you have gained nothing, and have done
    rightly in trusting to your innate ideas&mdash;or not rightly in
    distrusting them, as the case may be. You get, too, a little ...
    perhaps a considerable, good, in finding the world's accepted <i>moulds</i>
    everywhere, into which you may run and fix your own fused metal,&mdash;but
    not a grain Troy-weight do you get of new gold, silver or brass. After
    this, you go boldly on your own resources, and are justified to
    yourself, that's all. Three scratches with a pen,<a href="#note-14"><b>14</b></a> even with this
    pen,&mdash;and you have the green little Syrenusa where I have sate and
    heard the quails sing. One of these days I shall describe a country I
    have seen in my soul only, fruits, flowers, birds and all.

[Post-mark, April 18, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    If you did but know dear Mr. Browning how often I have written ... not
    this letter I am about to write, but another better letter to you, ...
    in the midst of my silence, ... you would not think for a moment that
    the east wind, with all the harm it does to me, is able to do the
    great harm of putting out the light of the thought of you to my mind;
    for this, indeed, it has no power to do. I had the pen in my hand once
    to write; and why it fell out, I cannot tell you. And you see, ... all
    your writing will not change the wind! You wished all manner of good
    to me one day as the clock struck ten; yes, and I assure you I was
    better that day&mdash;and I must not forget to tell you so though it is so
    long since. And <i>therefore</i>, I was logically bound to believe that you
    had never thought of me since ... unless you thought east winds of me!
    <i>That</i> was quite clear; was it not? or would have been; if it had not
    been for the supernatural conviction, I had above all, of your
    kindness, which was too large to be taken in the hinge of a syllogism.
    In fact I have long left off thinking that logic proves anything&mdash;it
    <i>doesn't</i>, you know.
</p>
<p>
    But your Lamia has taught you some subtle 'viperine' reasoning and
    <i>motiving</i>, for the turning down one street instead of another. It was
    conclusive.
</p>
<p>
    Ah&mdash;but you will never persuade me that I am the better, or as well,
    for the thing that I have not. We look from different points of view,
    and yours is the point of attainment. Not that you do not truly say
    that, when all is done, we must come home to place our engines, and
    act by our own strength. I do not want material as material; no one
    does&mdash;but every life requires a full experience, a various
    experience&mdash;and I have a profound conviction that where a poet has
    been shut from most of the outward aspects of life, he is at a
    lamentable disadvantage. Can you, speaking for yourself, separate the
    results in you from the external influences at work around you, that
    you say so boldly that you get nothing from the world? You do not
    <i>directly</i>, I know&mdash;but you do indirectly and by a rebound. Whatever
    acts upon you, becomes <i>you</i>&mdash;and whatever you love or hate, whatever
    charms you or is scorned by you, acts on you and becomes <i>you</i>. Have
    you read the 'Improvisatore'? or will you? The writer seems to feel,
    just as I do, the good of the outward life; and he is a poet in his
    soul. It is a book full of beauty and had a great charm to me.
</p>
<p>
    As to the Polkas and Cellariuses I do not covet them of course ... but
    what a strange world you seem to have, to me at a distance&mdash;what a
    strange husk of a world! How it looks to me like mandarin-life or
    something as remote; nay, not mandarin-life but mandarin <i>manners</i>,
    ... life, even the outer life, meaning something deeper, in my account
    of it. As to dear Mr. Kenyon I do not make the mistake of fancying
    that many can look like him or talk like him or <i>be</i> like him. I know
    enough to know otherwise. When he spoke of me he should have said that
    I was better notwithstanding the east wind. It is really true&mdash;I am
    getting slowly up from the prostration of the severe cold, and feel
    stronger in myself.
</p>
<p>
    But Mrs. Norton discourses excellent music&mdash;and for the rest, there
    are fruits in the world so over-ripe, that they will fall, ... without
    being gathered. Let Maynooth witness to it! <i>if you think it worth
    while</i>!

<p>
    If you did but know, dear Miss Barrett, how the 'full stop' after
    'Morning' just above, has turned out the fullest of stops,&mdash;and how
    for about a quarter of an hour since the ink dried I have been
    reasoning out the why and wherefore of the stopping, the wisdom of it,
    and the folly of it....
</p>
<p>
    By this time you see what you have got in me&mdash;You ask me questions,
    'if I like novels,' 'if the "Improvisatore" is not good,' 'if travel
    and sightseeing do not effect this and that for one,' and 'what I am
    devising&mdash;play or poem,'&mdash;and I shall not say I could not answer at
    all manner of lengths&mdash;but, let me only begin some good piece of
    writing of the kind, and ... no, you shall have it, have what I was
    going to tell you stops such judicious beginnings,&mdash;in a parallel
    case, out of which your ingenuity shall, please, pick the
    meaning&mdash;There is a story of D'Israeli's, an old one, with an episode
    of strange interest, or so I found it years ago,&mdash;well, you go
    breathlessly on with the people of it, page after page, till at last
    the end <i>must</i> come, you feel&mdash;and the tangled threads draw to one,
    and an out-of-door feast in the woods helps you ... that is, helps
    them, the people, wonderfully on,&mdash;and, lo, dinner is done, and Vivian
    Grey is here, and Violet Fane there,&mdash;and a detachment of the party is
    drafted off to go catch butterflies, and only two or three stop
    behind. At this moment, Mr. Somebody, a good man and rather the lady's
    uncle, 'in answer to a question from Violet, drew from his pocket a
    small neatly written manuscript, and, seating himself on an inverted
    wine-cooler, proceeded to read the following brief remarks upon the
    characteristics of the Moeso-gothic literature'&mdash;this ends the
    page,&mdash;which you don't turn at once! But when you <i>do</i>, in bitterness
    of soul, turn it, you read&mdash;'On consideration, I' (Ben, himself)
    'shall keep them for Mr. Colburn's <i>New Magazine</i>'&mdash;and deeply you
    draw thankful breath! (Note this 'parallel case' of mine is pretty
    sure to meet the usual fortune of my writings&mdash;you will ask what it
    means&mdash;and this it means, or should mean, all of it, instance and
    reasoning and all,&mdash;that I am naturally earnest, in earnest about
    whatever thing I do, and little able to write about one thing while I
    think of another)&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I think I will really write verse to you some day&mdash;<i>this</i> day, it is
    quite clear I had better give up trying.
</p>
<p>
    No, spite of all the lines in the world, I will make an end of it, as
    Ophelia with her swan's-song,&mdash;for it grows too absurd. But remember
    that I write letters to nobody but you, and that I want method and
    much more. That book you like so, the Danish novel, must be full of
    truth and beauty, to judge from the few extracts I have seen in
    Reviews. That a Dane should write so, confirms me in an old
    belief&mdash;that Italy is stuff for the use of the North, and no
    more&mdash;pure Poetry there is none, nearly as possible none, in Dante
    even&mdash;material for Poetry in the pitifullest romancist of their
    thousands, on the contrary&mdash;strange that those great wide black eyes
    should stare nothing out of the earth that lies before them! Alfieri,
    with even grey eyes, and a life of travel, writes you some fifteen
    tragedies as colourless as salad grown under a garden glass with
    matting over it&mdash;as free, that is, from local colouring, touches of
    the soil they are said to spring from,&mdash;think of 'Saulle,' and his
    Greek attempts!
</p>
<p>
    I expected to see Mr. Kenyon, at a place where I was last week, but he
    kept away. Here is the bad wind back again, and the black sky. I am
    sure I never knew till now whether the East or West or South were the
    quarter to pray for&mdash;But surely the weather was a little better last
    week, and you, were you not better? And do you know&mdash;but it's all
    self-flattery I believe,&mdash;still I cannot help fancying the East wind
    does my head harm too!

[Post-mark, May 2, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    People say of you and of me, dear Mr. Browning, that we love the
    darkness and use a sphinxine idiom in our talk; and really you do talk
    a little like a sphinx in your argument drawn from 'Vivian Grey.' Once
    I sate up all night to read 'Vivian Grey'; but I never drew such an
    argument from him. Not that I give it up (nor <i>you</i> up) for a mere
    mystery. Nor that I can '<i>see what you have got in you</i>,' from a mere
    guess. But just observe! If I ask questions about novels, is it not
    because I want to know how much elbow-room there may be for our
    sympathies ... and whether there is room for my loose sleeves, and the
    lace lappets, as well as for my elbows; and because I want to see
    <i>you</i> by the refracted lights as well as by the direct ones; and
    because I am willing for you to know <i>me</i> from the beginning, with all
    my weaknesses and foolishnesses, ... as they are accounted by people
    who say to me 'no one would ever think, without knowing you, that you
    were so and so.' Now if I send all my idle questions to <i>Colburn's
    Magazine</i>, with other Gothic literature, and take to standing up in a
    perpendicular personality like the angel on the schoolman's needle, in
    my letters to come, without further leaning to the left or the
    right&mdash;why the end would be that <i>you</i> would take to 'running after
    the butterflies,' for change of air and exercise. And then ... oh ...
    then, my 'small neatly written manuscripts' might fall back into my
    desk...! (<i>Not</i> a 'full stop'!.)
</p>
<p>
    Indeed ... I do assure you ... I never for a moment thought of 'making
    conversation' about the 'Improvisatore' or novels in general, when I
    wrote what I did to you. I might, to other persons ... perhaps.
    Certainly not to <i>you</i>. I was not dealing round from one pack of cards
    to you and to others. That's what you meant to reproach me for you
    know,&mdash;and of that, I am not guilty at all. I never could think of
    'making conversation' in a letter to <i>you</i>&mdash;never. Women are said to
    partake of the nature of children&mdash;and my brothers call me 'absurdly
    childish' sometimes: and I am capable of being childishly 'in earnest'
    about novels, and straws, and such 'puppydogs' tails' as my Flush's!
    Also I write more letters than you do, ... I write in fact almost as
    you pay visits, ... and one has to 'make conversation' in turn, of
    course. <i>But</i>&mdash;give me something to vow by&mdash;whatever you meant in the
    'Vivian Grey' argument, you were wrong in it! and you never can be
    much more wrong&mdash;which is a comfortable reflection.
</p>
<p>
    Yet you leap very high at Dante's crown&mdash;or you do not leap, ... you
    simply extend your hand to it, and make a rustling among the laurel
    leaves, which is somewhat prophane. Dante's poetry only materials for
    the northern rhymers! I must think of that ... if you please ...
    before I agree with you. Dante's poetry seems to come down in hail,
    rather than in rain&mdash;but count me the drops congealed in one
    hailstone! Oh! the 'Flight of the Duchess'&mdash;do let us hear more of
    her! Are you (I wonder) ... not a 'self-flatterer,' ... but ... a
    flatterer.

<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, May 3, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Now shall you see what you shall see&mdash;here shall be 'sound speech not
    to be reproved,'&mdash;for this morning you are to know that the soul of me
    has it all her own way, dear Miss Barrett, this green cool
    nine-in-the-morning time for my chestnut tree over there, and for me
    who only coaxed my good-natured&mdash;(really)&mdash;body up, after its
    three-hours' night-rest on condition it should lounge, or creep about,
    incognito and without consequences&mdash;and so it shall, all but my
    right-hand which is half-spirit and 'cuts' its poor relation, and
    passes itself off for somebody (that is, some soul) and is doubly
    active and ready on such occasions&mdash;Now I shall tell you all about it,
    first what last letter meant, and then more. You are to know, then
    that for some reason, that looked like an instinct, I thought I ought
    not to send shaft on shaft, letter-plague on letter, with such an
    uninterrupted clanging ... that I ought to wait, say a week at least
    having killed all your mules for you, before I shot down your
    dogs&mdash;but not being exactly Phoibos Apollon, you are to know further
    that when I <i>did</i> think I might go modestly on, ... <span title="ômoi">&omega;&mu;&omicron;&iota;</span>, let
    me get out of this slough of a simile, never mind with what
    dislocation of ancles! Plainly, from waiting and turning my eyes away
    (not from <i>you</i>, but from you in your special capacity of being
    <i>written</i>-to, not spoken-to) when I turned again you had grown
    formidable somehow&mdash;though that's not the word,&mdash;nor are you the
    person, either,&mdash;it was my fortune, my privilege of being your friend
    this one way, that it seemed a shame for me to make no better use of
    than taking it up with talk about books and I don't know what. Write
    what I will, you would read for once, I think&mdash;well, then,&mdash;what I
    shall write shall be&mdash;something on this book, and the other book, and
    my own books, and Mary Hewitt's books, and at the end of it&mdash;good bye,
    and I hope here is a quarter of an hour rationally spent. So the
    thought of what I should find in my heart to say, and the contrast
    with what I suppose I ought to say ... all these things are against
    me. But this is very foolish, all the same, I need not be told&mdash;and is
    part and parcel of an older&mdash;indeed primitive body of mine, which I
    shall never wholly get rid of, of desiring to do nothing when I cannot
    do all; seeing nothing, getting, enjoying nothing, where there is no
    seeing and getting and enjoying <i>wholly</i>&mdash;and in this case, moreover,
    you are <i>you</i>, and know something about me, if not much, and have read
    Bos on the art of supplying Ellipses, and (after, particularly, I have
    confessed all this, why and how it has been) you will <i>subaudire</i> when
    I pull out my Mediæval-Gothic-Architectural-Manuscript (so it was, I
    remember now,) and instruct you about corbeils and ogives ... though,
    after all, it was none of Vivian's doing, that,&mdash;all the uncle kind or
    man's, which I never professed to be. Now you see how I came to say
    some nonsense (I very vaguely think <i>what</i>) about Dante&mdash;some
    desperate splash I know I made for the beginning of my picture, as
    when a painter at his wits' end and hunger's beginning says 'Here
    shall the figure's hand be'&mdash;and spots <i>that</i> down, meaning to reach
    it naturally from the other end of his canvas,&mdash;and leaving off tired,
    there you see the spectral disjoined thing, and nothing between it and
    rationality. I intended to shade down and soften off and put in and
    leave out, and, before I had done, bring Italian Poets round to their
    old place again in my heart, giving new praise if I took old,&mdash;anyhow
    Dante is out of it all, as who knows but I, with all of him in my head
    and heart? But they do fret one, those tantalizing creatures, of fine
    passionate class, with such capabilities, and such a facility of being
    made pure mind of. And the special instance that vexed me, was that a
    man of sands and dog-roses and white rock and green sea-water just
    under, should come to Italy where my heart lives, and discover the
    sights and sounds ... certainly discover them. And so do all Northern
    writers; for take up handfuls of sonetti, rime, poemetti, doings of
    those who never did anything else,&mdash;and try and make out, for
    yourself, what ... say, what flowers they tread on, or trees they walk
    under,&mdash;as you might bid <i>them</i>, those tree and flower loving
    creatures, pick out of <i>our</i> North poetry a notion of what <i>our</i>
    daisies and harebells and furze bushes and brambles are&mdash;'Odorosi
    fioretti, rose porporine, bianchissimi gigli.' And which of you
    eternal triflers was it called yourself 'Shelley' and so told me years
    ago that in the mountains it was a feast

    so that when my Uncle walked into a sorb-tree, not to tumble sheer
    over Monte Calvano, and I felt the fruit against my face, the little
    ragged bare-legged guide fairly laughed at my knowing them so
    well&mdash;'Niursi&mdash;sorbi!' No, no,&mdash;does not all Naples-bay and half
    Sicily, shore and inland, come flocking once a year to the Piedigrotta
    fête only to see the blessed King's Volanti, or livery servants all in
    their best; as though heaven opened; and would not I engage to bring
    the whole of the Piano (of Sorrento) in likeness to a red velvet
    dressing gown properly spangled over, before the priest that held it
    out on a pole had even begun his story of how Noah's son Shem, the
    founder of Sorrento, threw it off to swim thither, as the world knows
    he did? Oh, it makes one's soul angry, so enough of it. But never
    enough of telling you&mdash;bring all your sympathies, come with loosest
    sleeves and longest lace-lappets, and you and yours shall find 'elbow
    room,' oh, shall you not! For never did man, woman or child, Greek,
    Hebrew, or as Danish as our friend, like a thing, not to say love it,
    but I liked and loved it, one liking neutralizing the rebellious stir
    of its fellow, so that I don't go about now wanting the fixed stars
    before my time; this world has not escaped me, thank God; and&mdash;what
    other people say is the best of it, may not escape me after all,
    though until so very lately I made up my mind to do without
    it;&mdash;perhaps, on that account, and to make fair amends to other
    people, who, I have no right to say, complain without cause. I have
    been surprised, rather, with something not unlike illness of late&mdash;I
    have had a constant pain in the head for these two months, which only
    very rough exercise gets rid of, and which stops my 'Luria' and much
    besides. I thought I never could be unwell. Just now all of it is
    gone, thanks to polking all night and walking home by broad daylight
    to the surprise of the thrushes in the bush here. And do you know I
    said 'this must <i>go</i>, cannot mean to stay, so I will not tell Miss
    Barrett why this and this is not done,'&mdash;but I mean to tell you all,
    or more of the truth, because you call me 'flatterer,' so that my eyes
    widened again! I, and in what? And of whom, pray? not of <i>you</i>, at all
    events,&mdash;of whom then? <i>Do</i> tell me, because I want to stand with
    you&mdash;and am quite in earnest there. And 'The Flight of the Duchess,'
    to leave nothing out, is only the beginning of a story written some
    time ago, and given to poor Hood in his emergency at a day's
    notice,&mdash;the true stuff and story is all to come, the 'Flight,' and
    what you allude to is the mere introduction&mdash;but the Magazine has
    passed into other hands and I must put the rest in some 'Bell' or
    other&mdash;it is one of my Dramatic Romances. So is a certain 'Saul' I
    should like to show you one day&mdash;an ominous liking&mdash;for nobody ever
    sees what I do till it is printed. But as you <i>do</i> know the printed
    little part of me, I should not be sorry if, in justice, you knew all
    I have <i>really</i> done,&mdash;written in the portfolio there,&mdash;though that
    would be far enough from <i>this</i> me, that wishes to you now. I should
    like to write something in concert with you, how I would try!
</p>
<p>
    I have read your letter through again. Does this clear up all the
    difficulty, and do you see that I never dreamed of 'reproaching you
    for dealing out one sort of cards to me and everybody else'&mdash;but that
    ... why, '<i>that</i>' which I have, I hope, said, so need not resay. I
    will tell you&mdash;Sydney Smith laughs somewhere at some Methodist or
    other whose wont was, on meeting an acquaintance in the street, to
    open at once on him with some enquiry after the state of his
    soul&mdash;Sydney knows better now, and sees that one might quite as wisely
    ask such questions as the price of Illinois stock or condition of
    glebe-land,&mdash;and I <i>could</i> say such&mdash;'could,'&mdash;the plague of it! So no
    more at present from your loving.... Or, let me tell you I am going to
    see Mr. Kenyon on the 12th inst.&mdash;that you do not tell me how you are,
    and that yet if you do not continue to improve in health ... I shall
    not see you&mdash;not&mdash;not&mdash;not&mdash;what 'knots' to untie! Surely the wind
    that sets my chestnut-tree dancing, all its baby-cone-blossoms, green
    now, rocking like fairy castles on a hill in an earthquake,&mdash;that is
    South West, surely! God bless you, and me in that&mdash;and do write to me
    soon, and tell me who was the 'flatterer,' and how he never was

    So when wise people happen to be ill, they sit up till six o'clock in
    the morning and get up again at nine? Do tell me how Lurias can ever
    be made out of such ungodly imprudences. If the wind blows east or
    west, where can any remedy be, while such evil deeds are being
    committed? And what is to be the end of it? And what is the
    reasonableness of it in the meantime, when we all know that thinking,
    dreaming, creating people like yourself, have two lives to bear
    instead of one, and therefore ought to sleep more than others, ...
    throwing over and buckling in that fold of death, to stroke the
    life-purple smoother. You have to live your own personal life, and
    also Luria's life&mdash;and therefore you should sleep for both. It is
    logical indeed&mdash;and rational, ... which logic is not always ... and if
    I had 'the tongue of men and of angels,' I would use it to persuade
    you. Polka, for the rest, may be good; but sleep is better. I think
    better of sleep than I ever did, now that she will not easily come
    near me except in a red hood of poppies. And besides, ... praise your
    'goodnatured body' as you like, ... it is only a seeming goodnature!
    Bodies bear malice in a terrible way, be very sure!&mdash;appear mild and
    smiling for a few short years, and then ... out with a cold steel; and
    the <i>soul has it</i>, 'with a vengeance,' ... according to the phrase!
    You will not persist, (will you?) in this experimental homicide. Or
    tell me if you will, that I may do some more tearing. It really,
    really is wrong. Exercise is one sort of rest and you feel relieved by
    it&mdash;and sleep is another: one being as necessary as the other.
</p>
<p>
    This is the first thing I have to say. The next is a question. <i>What
    do you mean about your manuscripts ... about 'Saul' and the
    portfolio?</i> for I am afraid of hazardously supplying ellipses&mdash;and
    your 'Bos' comes to <span title="bous epi glôssê">&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&pi;&iota; &gamma;&lambda;&omega;&sigma;&sigma;&eta;</span>.<b><a href="#note-15">15</a></b> I get half bribed to
    silence by the very pleasure of fancying. But if it could be possible
    that you should mean to say you would show me.... Can it be? or am I
    reading this 'Attic contraction' quite the wrong way? You see I am
    afraid of the difference between flattering myself and being
    flattered; the fatal difference. And now will you understand that I
    should be too overjoyed to have revelations from the 'Portfolio,' ...
    however incarnated with blots and pen-scratches, ... to be able to ask
    impudently of them now? Is that plain?
</p>
<p>
    It must be, ... at any rate, ... that if <i>you</i> would like to 'write
    something together' with me, <i>I</i> should like it still better. I should
    like it for some ineffable reasons. And I should not like it a bit the
    less for the grand supply of jests it would administer to the critical
    Board of Trade, about visible darkness, multiplied by two, mounting
    into palpable obscure. We should not mind ... should we? <i>you</i> would
    not mind, if you had got over certain other considerations
    deconsiderating to your coadjutor. Yes&mdash;but I dare not do it, ... I
    mean, think of it, ... just now, if ever: and I will tell you why in a
    Mediæval-Gothic-architectural manuscript.
</p>
<p>
    The only poet by profession (if I may say so,) except yourself, with
    whom I ever had much intercourse even on paper, (if this is near to
    'much') has been Mr. Horne. We approached each other on the point of
    one of Miss Mitford's annual editorships; and ever since, he has had
    the habit of writing to me occasionally; and when I was too ill to
    write at all, in my dreary Devonshire days, I was his debtor for
    various little kindnesses, ... for which I continue his debtor. In my
    opinion he is a truehearted and generous man. Do you not think so?
    Well&mdash;long and long ago, he asked me to write a drama with him on the
    Greek model; that is, for me to write the choruses, and for him to do
    the dialogue. Just then it was quite doubtful in my own mind, and
    worse than doubtful, whether I ever should write again; and the very
    doubtfulness made me speak my 'yes' more readily. Then I was desired
    to make a subject, ... to conceive a plan; and my plan was of a man,
    haunted by his own soul, ... (making her a separate personal Psyche, a
    dreadful, beautiful Psyche)&mdash;the man being haunted and terrified
    through all the turns of life by her. Did you ever feel afraid of your
    own soul, as I have done? I think it is a true wonder of our
    humanity&mdash;and fit subject enough for a wild lyrical drama. I should
    like to write it by myself at least, well enough. But with him I will
    not now. It was delayed ... delayed. He cut the plan up into scenes
    ... I mean into a list of scenes ... a sort of ground-map to work
    on&mdash;and there it lies. Nothing more was done. It all lies in one
    sheet&mdash;and I have offered to give up my copyright of idea in it&mdash;if he
    likes to use it alone&mdash;or I should not object to work it out alone on
    my own side, since it comes from me: only I will not consent now to a
    <i>double work</i> in it. There are objections&mdash;none, be it well
    understood, in Mr. Horne's disfavour,&mdash;for I think of him as well at
    this moment, and the same in all essential points, as I ever did. He
    is a man of fine imagination, and is besides good and generous. In the
    course of our acquaintance (on paper&mdash;for I never saw him) I never was
    angry with him except once; and then, <i>I</i> was quite wrong and had to
    confess it. But this is being too 'mediæval.' Only you will see from
    it that I am a little entangled on the subject of compound works, and
    must look where I tread ... and you will understand (if you ever hear
    from Mr. Kenyon or elsewhere that I am going to write a compound-poem
    with Mr. Horne) how it <i>was</i> true, and isn't true any more.
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;you are going to Mr. Kenyon's on the 12th&mdash;and yes&mdash;my brother
    and sister are going to meet you and your sister there one day to
    dinner. Shall I have courage to see you soon, I wonder! If you ask me,
    I must ask myself. But oh, this make-believe May&mdash;it can't be May
    after all! If a south-west wind sate in your chestnut tree, it was but
    for a few hours&mdash;the east wind 'came up this way' by the earliest
    opportunity of succession. As the old 'mysteries' showed 'Beelzebub
    with a bearde,' even so has the east wind had a 'bearde' of late, in a
    full growth of bristling exaggerations&mdash;the English spring-winds have
    excelled themselves in evil this year; and I have not been down-stairs
    yet.&mdash;<i>But</i> I am certainly stronger and better than I was&mdash;that is
    undeniable&mdash;and I <i>shall</i> be better still. You are not going away
    soon&mdash;are you? In the meantime you do not know what it is to be ... a
    little afraid of Paracelsus. So right about the Italians! and the
    'rose porporine' which made me smile. How is the head?

    Monday. I had been thinking so of seeing you on Tuesday ... with my

    My dear, own friend, I am quite well now, or next to it&mdash;but this is
    how it was,&mdash;I have gone out a great deal of late, and my head took to
    ringing such a literal alarum that I wondered what was to come of it;
    and at last, a few evenings ago, as I was dressing for a dinner
    somewhere, I got really bad of a sudden, and kept at home to my
    friend's heartrending disappointment. Next morning I was no
    better&mdash;and it struck me that I should be really disappointing dear
    kind Mr. Kenyon, and wasting his time, if that engagement, too, were
    broken with as little warning,&mdash;so I thought it best to forego all
    hopes of seeing him, at such a risk. And that done, I got rid of every
    other promise to pay visits for next week and next, and told
    everybody, with considerable dignity, that my London season was over
    for this year, as it assuredly is&mdash;and I shall be worried no more, and
    let walk in the garden, and go to bed at ten o'clock, and get done
    with what is most expedient to do, and my 'flesh shall come again like
    a little child's,' and one day, oh the day, I shall see you with my
    own, own eyes ... for, how little you understand me; or rather,
    yourself,&mdash;if you think I would dare see you, without your leave, that
    way! Do you suppose that your power of giving and refusing ends when
    you have shut your room-door? Did I not tell you I turned down another
    street, even, the other day, and why not down yours? And often as I
    see Mr. Kenyon, have I ever dreamed of asking any but the merest
    conventional questions about you; your health, and no more?

    Did I thank you with any effect in the lines I sent yesterday, dear
    Miss Barrett? I know I felt most thankful, and, of course, began
    reasoning myself into the impropriety of allowing a 'more' or a 'most'
    in feelings of that sort towards you. I am thankful for you, all about
    you&mdash;as, do you not know?
</p>
<p>
    Thank you, from my soul.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let me never pass occasion of speaking well of Horne, who
    deserves your opinion of him,&mdash;it is my own, too.&mdash;He has unmistakable
    genius, and is a fine, honest, enthusiastic chivalrous fellow&mdash;it is
    the fashion to affect to sneer at him, of late, I think&mdash;the people he
    has praised fancying that they 'pose' themselves sculpturesquely in
    playing the Greatly Indifferent, and the other kind shaking each
    other's hands in hysterical congratulations at having escaped such a
    dishonour: <i>I</i> feel grateful to him, I know, for his generous
    criticism, and glad and proud of in any way approaching such a man's
    standard of poetical height. And he might be a disappointed man
    too,&mdash;for the players trifled with and teased out his very nature,
    which has a strange aspiration for the horrible tin-and-lacquer
    'crown' they give one from their clouds (of smooth shaven deal done
    over blue)&mdash;and he don't give up the bad business yet, but thinks a
    'small' theatre would somehow not be a theatre, and an actor not quite
    an actor ... I forget in what way, but the upshot is, he bates not a
    jot in that rouged, wigged, padded, empty-headed, heartless tribe of
    grimacers that came and canted me; not I, them;&mdash;a thing he cannot
    understand&mdash;<i>so</i>, I am not the one he would have picked out to
    praise, had he not been <i>loyal</i>. I know he admires your poetry
    properly. God help him, and send some great artist from the country,
    (who can read and write beside comprehending Shakspeare, and who
    'exasperates his H's' when the feat is to be done)&mdash;to undertake the
    part of Cosmo, or Gregory, or what shall most soothe his spirit! The
    subject of your play is tempting indeed&mdash;and reminds one of that wild
    Drama of Calderon's which frightened Shelley just before his
    death&mdash;also, of Fuseli's theory with reference to his own Picture of
    Macbeth in the witches' cave ... wherein the apparition of the armed
    head from the cauldron is Macbeth's own.
</p>
<p>
    'If you ask me, I must ask myself'&mdash;that is, when I am to see you&mdash;I
    will <i>never</i> ask you! You do <i>not</i> know what I shall estimate that
    permission at,&mdash;nor do I, quite&mdash;but you do&mdash;do not you? know so much
    of me as to make my 'asking' worse than a form&mdash;I do not 'ask' you to
    write to me&mdash;not <i>directly</i> ask, at least.
</p>
<p>
    I will tell you&mdash;I ask you <i>not</i> to see me so long as you are unwell,
    or mistrustful of&mdash;
</p>

    No, no, that is being too grand! Do see me when you can, and let me

<h3>
    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday.<br>
[Post-mark, May 16, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    But how 'mistrustfulness'? And how 'that way?' What have I said or
    done, <i>I</i>, who am not apt to <i>be</i> mistrustful of anybody and should be
    a miraculous monster if I began with <i>you</i>! What can I have said, I
    say to myself again and again.
</p>
<p>
    One thing, at any rate, I have done, 'that way' or this way! I have
    made what is vulgarly called a 'piece of work' about little; or seemed
    to make it. Forgive me. I am shy by nature:&mdash;and by position and
    experience, ... by having had my nerves shaken to excess, and by
    leading a life of such seclusion, ... by these things together and by
    others besides, I have appeared shy and ungrateful to you. Only not
    mistrustful. You could not mean to judge me so. Mistrustful people do
    not write as I write, surely! for wasn't it a Richelieu or Mazarin (or
    who?) who said that with five lines from anyone's hand, he could take
    off his head for a corollary? I think so.
</p>
<p>
    Well!&mdash;but this is to prove that I am not mistrustful, and to say,
    that if you care to come to see me you can come; and that it is my
    gain (as I feel it to be) and not yours, whenever you do come. You
    will not talk of having come afterwards I know, because although I am
    'fast bound' to see one or two persons this summer (besides yourself,
    whom I receive of choice and willingly) I <i>cannot</i> admit visitors in a
    general way&mdash;and putting the question of health quite aside, it would
    be unbecoming to lie here on the sofa and make a company-show of an
    infirmity, and hold a beggar's hat for sympathy. I should blame it in
    another woman&mdash;and the sense of it has had its weight with me
    sometimes.
</p>
<p>
    For the rest, ... when you write, that <i>I</i> do not know how you would
    value, &amp;c. <i>nor yourself quite</i>, you touch very accurately on the
    truth ... and <i>so</i> accurately in the last clause, that to read it,
    made me smile 'tant bien que mal.' Certainly you cannot 'quite know,'
    or know at all, whether the least straw of pleasure can go to you from
    knowing me otherwise than on this paper&mdash;and I, for my part, 'quite
    know' my own honest impression, dear Mr. Browning, that none is likely
    to go to you. There is nothing to see in me; nor to hear in me&mdash;I
    never learnt to talk as you do in London; although I can admire that
    brightness of carved speech in Mr. Kenyon and others. If my poetry is
    worth anything to any eye, it is the flower of me. I have lived most
    and been most happy in it, and so it has all my colours; the rest of
    me is nothing but a root, fit for the ground and the dark. And if I
    write all this egotism, ... it is for shame; and because I feel
    ashamed of having made a fuss about what is not worth it; and because
    you are extravagant in caring so for a permission, which will be
    nothing to you afterwards. Not that I am not touched by your caring so
    at all! I am deeply touched now; and presently, ... I shall
    understand. Come then. There will be truth and simplicity for you in
    any case; and a friend. And do not answer this&mdash;I do not write it as a
    fly trap for compliments. Your spider would scorn me for it too much.
    Also, ... as to the how and when. You are not well now, and it cannot
    be good for you to do anything but be quiet and keep away that
    dreadful musical note in the head. I entreat you not to think of
    coming until <i>that</i> is all put to silence satisfactorily. When it is
    done, ... you must choose whether you would like best to come with Mr.
    Kenyon or to come alone&mdash;and if you would come alone, you must just
    tell me on what day, and I will see you on any day unless there should
    be an unforeseen obstacle, ... any day after two, or before six. And
    my sister will bring you up-stairs to me; and we will talk; or <i>you</i>
    will talk; and you will try to be indulgent, and like me as well as
    you can. If, on the other hand, you would rather come with Mr. Kenyon,
    you must wait, I imagine, till June,&mdash;because he goes away on Monday
    and is not likely immediately to return&mdash;no, on Saturday, to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, why I should be '<i>thanked</i>,' is an absolute mystery
    to me&mdash;but I leave it!
</p>
<p>
    You are generous and impetuous; <i>that</i>, I can see and feel; and so far
    from being of an inclination to mistrust you or distrust you, I do
    profess to have as much faith in your full, pure loyalty, as if I had
    known you personally as many years as I have appreciated your genius.
    Believe this of me&mdash;for it is spoken truly.
</p>
<p>
    In the matter of Shakespeare's 'poor players' you are severe&mdash;and yet
    I was glad to hear you severe&mdash;it is a happy excess, I think. When men
    of intense reality, as all great poets must be, give their hearts to
    be trodden on and tied up with ribbons in turn, by men of masks, there
    will be torture if there is not desecration. Not that I know much of
    such things&mdash;but I have <i>heard</i>. Heard from Mr. Kenyon; heard from
    Miss Mitford; who however is passionately fond of the theatre as a
    writer's medium&mdash;<i>not at all</i>, from Mr. Horne himself, ... except what
    he has printed on the subject.
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;he has been infamously used on the point of the 'New
    Spirit'&mdash;only he should have been prepared for the infamy&mdash;it was
    leaping into a gulph, ... not to 'save the republic,' but '<i>pour
    rire</i>': it was not merely putting one's foot into a hornet's nest, but
    taking off a shoe and stocking to do it. And to think of Dickens being
    dissatisfied! To think of Tennyson's friends grumbling!&mdash;he himself
    did not, I hope and trust. For you, you certainly were not adequately
    treated&mdash;and above all, you were not placed with your <i>peers</i> in that
    chapter&mdash;but that there was an intention to do you justice, and that
    there <i>is</i> a righteous appreciation of you in the writer, I know and
    am sure,&mdash;and that <i>you</i> should be sensible to this, is only what I
    should know and be sure of <i>you</i>. Mr. Horne is quite above the narrow,
    vicious, hateful jealousy of contemporaries, which we hear reproached,
    too justly sometimes, on men of letters.
</p>
<p>
    I go on writing as if I were not going to see you&mdash;soon perhaps.
    Remember that the how and the when rest with you&mdash;except that it
    cannot be before next week at the soonest. You are to decide.

    My friend is not 'mistrustful' of me, no, because she don't fear I
    shall make mainprize of the stray cloaks and umbrellas down-stairs, or
    turn an article for <i>Colburn's</i> on her sayings and doings
    up-stairs,&mdash;but spite of that, she does mistrust ... <i>so</i> mistrust my
    common sense,&mdash;nay, uncommon and dramatic-poet's sense, if I am put on
    asserting it!&mdash;all which pieces of mistrust I could detect, and catch
    struggling, and pin to death in a moment, and put a label in, with
    name, genus and species, just like a horrible entomologist; only I
    won't, because the first visit of the Northwind will carry the whole
    tribe into the Red Sea&mdash;and those horns and tails and scalewings are
    best forgotten altogether. And now will I say a cutting thing and have
    done. Have I trusted <i>my</i> friend so,&mdash;or said even to myself, much
    less to her, she is even as&mdash;'Mr. Simpson' who desireth the honour of
    the acquaintance of Mr. B. whose admirable works have long been his,
    Simpson's, especial solace in private&mdash;and who accordingly is led to
    that personage by a mutual friend&mdash;Simpson blushing as only adorable
    ingenuousness can, and twisting the brim of his hat like a sailor
    giving evidence. Whereupon Mr. B. beginneth by remarking that the
    rooms are growing hot&mdash;or that he supposes Mr. S. has not heard if
    there will be another adjournment of the House to-night&mdash;whereupon Mr.
    S. looketh up all at once, brusheth the brim smooth again with his
    sleeve, and takes to his assurance once more, in something of a huff,
    and after staying his five minutes out for decency's sake, noddeth
    familiarly an adieu, and spinning round on his heel ejaculateth
    mentally&mdash;'Well, I <i>did</i> expect to see something different from that
    little yellow commonplace man ... and, now I come to think, there
    <i>was</i> some precious trash in that book of his'&mdash;Have <i>I</i> said 'so will
    Miss Barrett ejaculate?'
</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss Barrett, I thank you for the leave you give me, and for the
    infinite kindness of the way of giving it. I will call at 2 on
    Tuesday&mdash;not sooner, that you may have time to write should any
    adverse circumstances happen ... not that they need inconvenience you,
    because ... what I want particularly to tell you for now and
    hereafter&mdash;do not mind my coming in the least, but&mdash;should you be
    unwell, for instance,&mdash;just send or leave word, and I will come again,
    and again, and again&mdash;my time is of <i>no</i> importance, and I have
    acquaintances thick in the vicinity.

    Now if I do not seem grateful enough to you, <i>am</i> I so much to blame?

<p>
    I shall be ready on Tuesday I hope, but I hate and protest against
    your horrible 'entomology.' Beginning to explain, would thrust me
    lower and lower down the circles of some sort of an 'Inferno'; only
    with my dying breath I would maintain that I never could, consciously
    or unconsciously, mean to distrust you; or, the least in the world, to
    Simpsonize you. What I said, ... it was <i>you</i> that put it into my head
    to say it&mdash;for certainly, in my usual disinclination to receive
    visitors, such a feeling does not enter. There, now! There, I am a
    whole 'giro' lower! Now, you will say perhaps that I distrust <i>you</i>,
    and nobody else! So it is best to be silent, and bear all the 'cutting
    things' with resignation! <i>that</i> is certain.
</p>
<p>
    Still I must really say, under this dreadful incubus-charge of
    Simpsonism, ... that you, who know everything, or at least make awful
    guesses at everything in one's feelings and motives, and profess to be
    able to pin them down in a book of classified inscriptions, ... should
    have been able to understand better, or misunderstand less, in a
    matter like this&mdash;Yes! I think so. I think you should have made out
    the case in some such way as it was in nature&mdash;viz. that you had
    lashed yourself up to an exorbitant wishing to see me, ... (you who
    could see, any day, people who are a hundredfold and to all social
    purposes, my superiors!) because I was unfortunate enough to be shut
    up in a room and silly enough to make a fuss about opening the door;
    and that I grew suddenly abashed by the consciousness of this. How
    different from a distrust of <i>you</i>! how different!
</p>
<p>
    Ah&mdash;if, after this day, you ever see any interpretable sign of
    distrustfulness in me, you may be 'cutting' again, and I will not cry
    out. In the meantime here is a fact for your 'entomology.' I have not
    so much <i>distrust</i>, as will make a <i>doubt</i>, as will make a <i>curiosity</i>
    for next Tuesday. Not the simplest modification of <i>curiosity</i> enters
    into the state of feeling with which I wait for Tuesday:&mdash;and if you
    are angry to hear me say so, ... why, you are more unjust than ever.
</p>
<p>
    (Let it be three instead of two&mdash;if the hour be as convenient to
    yourself.)
</p>
<p>
    Before you come, try to forgive me for my 'infinite kindness' in the
    manner of consenting to see you. Is it 'the cruellest cut of all' when
    you talk of infinite kindness, yet attribute such villainy to me?

<p>
    Indeed there was nothing wrong&mdash;how could there be? And there was
    everything right&mdash;as how should there not be? And as for the 'loud
    speaking,' I did not hear any&mdash;and, instead of being worse, I ought to
    be better for what was certainly (to speak it, or be silent of it,)
    happiness and honour to me yesterday.
</p>
<p>
    Which reminds me to observe that you are so restricting our
    vocabulary, as to be ominous of silence in a full sense, presently.
    First, one word is not to be spoken&mdash;and then, another is not. And
    why? Why deny me the use of such words as have natural feelings
    belonging to them&mdash;and how can the use of such be 'humiliating' to
    <i>you</i>? If my heart were open to you, you could see nothing offensive
    to you in any thought there or trace of thought that has been
    there&mdash;but it is hard for you to understand, with all your psychology
    (and to be reminded of it I have just been looking at the preface of
    some poems by some Mr. Gurney where he speaks of 'the reflective
    wisdom of a Wordsworth and the profound psychological utterances of a
    Browning') it is hard for you to understand what my mental position is
    after the peculiar experience I have suffered, and what <span title="ti emoi kai soi">&tau;&iota; &epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &sigma;&omicron;&iota;</span><b><a href="#note-17">17</a></b> a sort of feeling is irrepressible from me to you,
    when, from the height of your brilliant happy sphere, you ask, as you
    did ask, for personal intercourse with me. What words but 'kindness'
    ... but 'gratitude'&mdash;but I will not in any case be <i>un</i>kind and
    <i>un</i>grateful, and do what is displeasing to you. And let us both leave
    the subject with the words&mdash;because we perceive in it from different
    points of view; we stand on the black and white sides of the shield;
    and there is no coming to a conclusion.

    But you will come really on Tuesday&mdash;and again, when you like and can

    if I disobey you, my dear friend, in speaking, (I for my part) of your
    wild speaking, I do it, not to displease you, but to be in my own
    eyes, and before God, a little more worthy, or less unworthy, of a
    generosity from which I recoil by instinct and at the first glance,
    yet conclusively; and because my silence would be the most disloyal of
    all means of expression, in reference to it. Listen to me then in
    this. You have said some intemperate things ... fancies,&mdash;which you
    will not say over again, nor unsay, but <i>forget at once</i>, and <i>for
    ever, having said at all</i>; and which (so) will die out between <i>you
    and me alone</i>, like a misprint between you and the printer. And this
    you will do <i>for my sake</i> who am your friend (and you have none
    truer)&mdash;and this I ask, because it is a condition necessary to our
    future liberty of intercourse. You remember&mdash;surely you do&mdash;that I am
    in the most exceptional of positions; and that, just <i>because of it</i>,
    I am able to receive you as I did on Tuesday; and that, for me to
    listen to 'unconscious exaggerations,' is as unbecoming to the
    humilities of my position, as unpropitious (which is of more
    consequence) to the prosperities of yours. Now, if there should be one
    word of answer attempted to this; or of reference; <i>I must not</i> ... I
    <i>will not see you again</i>&mdash;and you will justify me later in your heart.
    So for my sake you will not say it&mdash;I think you will not&mdash;and spare me
    the sadness of having to break through an intercourse just as it is
    promising pleasure to me; to me who have so many sadnesses and so few
    pleasures. You will!&mdash;and I need not be uneasy&mdash;and I shall owe you
    that tranquillity, as one gift of many. For, that I have much to
    receive from you in all the free gifts of thinking, teaching,
    master-spirits, ... <i>that</i>, I know!&mdash;it is my own praise that I
    appreciate you, as none can more. Your influence and help in poetry
    will be full of good and gladness to me&mdash;for with many to love me in
    this house, there is no one to judge me ... <i>now</i>. Your friendship and
    sympathy will be dear and precious to me all my life, if you indeed
    leave them with me so long or so little. Your mistakes in me ... which
    <i>I</i> cannot mistake (&mdash;and which have humbled me by too much
    honouring&mdash;) I put away gently, and with grateful tears in my eyes;
    because <i>all that hail</i> will beat down and spoil crowns, as well as
    'blossoms.'
</p>
<p>
    If I put off next Tuesday to the week after&mdash;I mean your visit,&mdash;shall
    you care much? For the relations I named to you, are to be in London
    next week; and I am to see one of my aunts whom I love, and have not
    met since my great affliction&mdash;and it will all seem to come over
    again, and I shall be out of spirits and nerves. On Tuesday week you
    can bring a tomahawk and do the criticism, and I shall try to have my
    courage ready for it&mdash;Oh, you will do me so much good&mdash;and Mr. Kenyon
    calls me 'docile' sometimes I assure you; when he wants to flatter me
    out of being obstinate&mdash;and in good earnest, I believe I shall do
    everything you tell me. The 'Prometheus' is done&mdash;but the monodrama is
    where it was&mdash;and the novel, not at all. But I think of some half
    promises half given, about something I read for 'Saul'&mdash;and the
    'Flight of the Duchess'&mdash;where is she?
</p>
<p>
    You are not displeased with me? <i>no, that</i> would be hail and lightning
    together&mdash;I do not write as I might, of some words of yours&mdash;but you
    know that I am not a stone, even if silent like one. And if in the
    <i>un</i>silence, I have said one word to vex you, pity me for having had
    to say it&mdash;and for the rest, may God bless you far beyond the reach of
    vexation from my words or my deeds!

    <i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, May 24, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Don't you remember I told you, once on a time that you 'knew nothing
    of me'? whereat you demurred&mdash;but I meant what I said, and knew it was
    so. To be grand in a simile, for every poor speck of a Vesuvius or a
    Stromboli in my microcosm there are huge layers of ice and pits of
    black cold water&mdash;and I make the most of my two or three fire-eyes,
    because I know by experience, alas, how these tend to extinction&mdash;and
    the ice grows and grows&mdash;still this last is true part of me, most
    characteristic part, <i>best</i> part perhaps, and I disown
    nothing&mdash;only,&mdash;when you talked of '<i>knowing</i> me'! Still, I am utterly
    unused, of these late years particularly, to dream of communicating
    anything about <i>that</i> to another person (all my writings are purely
    dramatic as I am always anxious to say) that when I make never so
    little an attempt, no wonder if I <i>bungle</i> notably&mdash;'language,' too is
    an organ that never studded this heavy heavy head of mine. Will you
    not think me very brutal if I tell you I could almost smile at your
    misapprehension of what I meant to write?&mdash;Yet I <i>will</i> tell you,
    because it will undo the bad effect of my thoughtlessness, and at the
    same time exemplify the point I have all along been honestly earnest
    to set you right upon ... my real inferiority to you; just that and no
    more. I wrote to you, in an unwise moment, on the spur of being again
    'thanked,' and, unwisely writing just as if thinking to myself, said
    what must have looked absurd enough as seen apart from the horrible
    counterbalancing never-to-be-written <i>rest of me</i>&mdash;by the side of
    which, could it be written and put before you, my note would sink to
    its proper and relative place, and become a mere 'thank you' for your
    good opinion&mdash;which I assure you is far too generous&mdash;for I really
    believe you to be my superior in many respects, and feel uncomfortable
    till <i>you</i> see that, too&mdash;since I hope for your sympathy and
    assistance, and 'frankness is everything in such a case.' I do assure
    you, that had you read my note, <i>only</i> having '<i>known</i>' so much of me
    as is implied in having inspected, for instance, the contents, merely,
    of that fatal and often-referred-to 'portfolio' there (<i>Dii meliora
    piis!</i>), you would see in it, (the note not the portfolio) the
    blandest utterance ever mild gentleman gave birth to. But I forgot
    that one may make too much noise in a silent place by playing the few
    notes on the 'ear-piercing fife' which in Othello's regimental band
    might have been thumped into decent subordination by his
    'spirit-stirring drum'&mdash;to say nothing of gong and ophicleide. Will
    you forgive me, on promise to remember for the future, and be more
    considerate? Not that you must too much despise me, neither; nor, of
    all things, apprehend I am attitudinizing à la Byron, and giving you
    to understand unutterable somethings, longings for Lethe and all
    that&mdash;far from it! I never committed murders, and sleep the soundest
    of sleeps&mdash;but 'the heart is desperately wicked,' that is true, and
    though I dare not say 'I know' mine, yet I have had signal
    opportunities, I who began life from the beginning, and can forget
    nothing (but names, and the date of the battle of Waterloo), and have
    known good and wicked men and women, gentle and simple, shaking hands
    with Edmund Kean and Father Mathew, you and&mdash;Ottima! Then, I had a
    certain faculty of self-consciousness, years and years ago, at which
    John Mill wondered, and which ought to be improved by this time, if
    constant use helps at all&mdash;and, meaning, on the whole, to be a Poet,
    if not <i>the</i> Poet ... for I am vain and ambitious some nights,&mdash;I do
    myself justice, and dare call things by their names to myself, and say
    boldly, this I love, this I hate, this I would do, this I would not
    do, under all kinds of circumstances,&mdash;and talking (thinking) in this
    style <i>to myself</i>, and beginning, however tremblingly, in spite of
    conviction, to write in this style <i>for myself</i>&mdash;on the top of the
    desk which contains my 'Songs of the Poets&mdash;<SPAN class="sc-ex">no. i</span> M.P.', I
    wrote,&mdash;what you now forgive, I know! Because I am, from my heart,
    sorry that by a foolish fit of inconsideration I should have given
    pain for a minute to you, towards whom, on every account, I would
    rather soften and 'sleeken every word as to a bird' ... (and, not such
    a bird as my black self that go screeching about the world for 'dead
    horse'&mdash;corvus (picus)&mdash;mirandola!) I, too, who have been at such
    pains to acquire the reputation I enjoy in the world,&mdash;(ask Mr.
    Kenyon,) and who dine, and wine, and dance and enhance the company's
    pleasure till they make me ill and I keep house, as of late: Mr.
    Kenyon, (for I only quote where you may verify if you please) <i>he</i>
    says my common sense strikes him, and its contrast with my muddy
    metaphysical poetry! And so it shall strike you&mdash;for though I am glad
    that, since you <i>did</i> misunderstand me, you said so, and have given me
    an opportunity of doing by another way what I wished to do in
    <i>that</i>,&mdash;yet, if you had <i>not</i> alluded to my writing, as I meant you
    should not, you would have certainly understood <i>something</i> of its
    drift when you found me next Tuesday precisely the same quiet (no, for
    I feel I speak too loudly, in spite of your kind disclaimer, but&mdash;)
    the same mild man-about-town you were gracious to, the other
    morning&mdash;for, indeed, my own way of worldly life is marked out long
    ago, as precisely as yours can be, and I am set going with a hand,
    winker-wise, on each side of my head, and a directing finger before my
    eyes, to say nothing of an instinctive dread I have that a certain
    whip-lash is vibrating somewhere in the neighbourhood in playful
    readiness! So 'I hope here be proofs,' Dogberry's satisfaction that,
    first, I am but a very poor creature compared to you and entitled by
    my wants to look up to you,&mdash;all I meant to say from the first of the
    first&mdash;and that, next, I shall be too much punished if, for this piece
    of mere inconsideration, you deprive me, more or less, or sooner or
    later, of the pleasure of seeing you,&mdash;a little over boisterous
    gratitude for which, perhaps, caused all the mischief! The reasons you
    give for deferring my visits next week are too cogent for me to
    dispute&mdash;that is too true&mdash;and, being now and henceforward 'on my good
    behaviour,' I will at once cheerfully submit to them, if needs
    must&mdash;but should your mere kindness and forethought, as I half
    suspect, have induced you to take such a step, you will now smile with
    me, at this new and very unnecessary addition to the 'fears of me' I
    have got so triumphantly over in your case! Wise man, was I not, to
    clench my first favourable impression so adroitly ... like a recent
    Cambridge worthy, my sister heard of; who, being on his theological
    (or rather, scripture-historical) examination, was asked by the Tutor,
    who wished to let him off easily, 'who was the first King of
    Israel?'&mdash;'Saul' answered the trembling youth. 'Good!' nodded
    approvingly the Tutor. 'Otherwise called <i>Paul</i>,' subjoined the youth
    in his elation! Now I have begged pardon, and blushingly assured you
    <i>that</i> was only a slip of the tongue, and that I did really <i>mean</i> all
    the while, (Paul or no Paul), the veritable son of Kish, he that owned
    the asses, and found listening to the harp the best of all things for
    an evil spirit! Pray write me a line to say, 'Oh ... if <i>that's</i> all!'
    and remember me for good (which is very compatible with a moment's
    stupidity) and let me not for one fault, (and that the only one that
    shall be), lose <i>any pleasure</i> ... for your friendship I am sure I
    have not lost&mdash;God bless you, my dear friend!
</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><SPAN class="sc-ex">R. Browning</span>.
</p>
<p>
    And by the way, will it not be better, as co-operating with you more
    effectually in your kind promise to forget the 'printer's error' in my
    blotted proof, to send me back that same 'proof,' if you have not
    inflicted proper and summary justice on it? When Mephistopheles last
    came to see us in this world outside here, he counselled sundry of us
    'never to write a letter,&mdash;and never to burn one'&mdash;do you know that?
    But I never mind what I am told! Seriously, I am ashamed.... I shall
    next ask a servant for my paste in the 'high fantastical' style of my
    own 'Luria.'

<br>
<h3>
    <i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday<br>
[May 25, 1845].
</p>
<p>
    I owe you the most humble of apologies dear Mr. Browning, for having
    spent so much solemnity on so simple a matter, and I hasten to pay it;
    confessing at the same time (as why should I not?) that I am quite as
    much ashamed of myself as I ought to be, which is not a little. You
    will find it difficult to believe me perhaps when I assure you that I
    never made such a mistake (I mean of over-seriousness to indefinite
    compliments), no, never in my life before&mdash;indeed my sisters have
    often jested with me (in matters of which they were cognizant) on my
    supernatural indifference to the superlative degree in general, as if
    it meant nothing in grammar. I usually know well that 'boots' may be
    called for in this world of ours, just as you called for yours; and
    that to bring '<i>Bootes</i>,' were the vilest of mal-à-pro-pos-ities.
    Also, I should have understood 'boots' where you wrote it, in the
    letter in question; if it had not been for <i>the relation of two
    things</i> in it&mdash;and now I perfectly seem to see <i>how</i> I mistook that
    relation; ('<i>seem to see</i>'; because I have not looked into the letter
    again since your last night's commentary, and will not&mdash;) inasmuch as
    I have observed before in my own mind, that a good deal of what is
    called obscurity in you, arises from a habit of very subtle
    association; so subtle, that you are probably unconscious of it, ...
    and the effect of which is to throw together on the same level and in
    the same light, things of likeness and unlikeness&mdash;till the reader
    grows confused as I did, and takes one for another. I may say however,
    in a poor justice to myself, that I wrote what I wrote so
    unfortunately, <i>through reverence for you</i>, and not at all from vanity
    in my own account ... although I do feel palpably while I write these
    words here and now, that I might as well leave them unwritten; for
    that no man of the world who ever lived in the world (not even <i>you</i>)
    could be expected to believe them, though said, sung, and sworn.
</p>
<p>
    For the rest, it is scarcely an apposite moment for you to talk, even
    'dramatically,' of my 'superiority' to you, ... unless you mean, which
    perhaps you do mean, my superiority in <i>simplicity</i>&mdash;and, verily, to
    some of the 'adorable ingenuousness,' sacred to the shade of Simpson,
    I may put in a modest claim, ... 'and have my claim allowed.' 'Pray do
    not mock me' I quote again from your Shakespeare to you who are a
    dramatic poet; ... and I will admit anything that you like, (being
    humble just now)&mdash;even that I <i>did not know you</i>. I was certainly
    innocent of the knowledge of the 'ice and cold water' you introduce me
    to, and am only just shaking my head, as Flush would, after a first
    wholesome plunge. Well&mdash;if I do not know you, I shall learn, I
    suppose, in time. I am ready to try humbly to learn&mdash;and I may
    perhaps&mdash;if you are not done in Sanscrit, which is too hard for me,
    ... notwithstanding that I had the pleasure yesterday to hear, from
    America, of my profound skill in 'various languages less known than
    Hebrew'!&mdash;a liberal paraphrase on Mr. Horne's large fancies on the
    like subject, and a satisfactory reputation in itself&mdash;as long as it
    is not necessary to deserve it. So I here enclose to you your letter
    back again, as you wisely desire; although you never could doubt, I
    hope, for a moment, of its safety with me in the completest of senses:
    and then, from the heights of my superior ... stultity, and other
    qualities of the like order, ... I venture to advise you ... however
    (to speak of the letter critically, and as the dramatic composition it
    is) it is to be admitted to be very beautiful, and well worthy of the
    rest of its kin in the portfolio, ... 'Lays of the Poets,' or
    otherwise, ... I venture to advise you to burn it at once. And then,
    my dear friend, I ask you (having some claim) to burn at the same time
    the letter I was fortunate enough to write to you on Friday, and this
    present one&mdash;don't send them back to me; I hate to have letters sent
    back&mdash;but burn them for me and never mind Mephistopheles. After which
    friendly turn, you will do me the one last kindness of forgetting all
    this exquisite nonsense, and of refraining from mentioning it, by
    breath or pen, <i>to me or another</i>. Now I trust you so far:&mdash;you will
    put it with the date of the battle of Waterloo&mdash;and I, with every date
    in chronology; seeing that I can remember none of them. And we will
    shuffle the cards and take patience, and begin the game again, if you
    please&mdash;and I shall bear in mind that you are a dramatic poet, which
    is not the same thing, by any means, with <i>us</i> of the primitive
    simplicities, who don't tread on cothurns nor shift the mask in the
    scene. And I will reverence you both as 'a poet' and as '<i>the</i> poet';
    because it is no false 'ambition,' but a right you have&mdash;and one which
    those who live longest, will see justified to the uttermost.... In the
    meantime I need not ask Mr. Kenyon if you have any sense, because I
    have no doubt that you have quite sense enough&mdash;and even if I had a
    doubt, I shall prefer judging for myself without interposition; which
    I can do, you know, as long as you like to come and see me. And you
    can come this week if you do like it&mdash;because our relations don't come
    till the end of it, it appears&mdash;not that I made a pretence 'out of
    kindness'&mdash;pray don't judge me so outrageously&mdash;but if you like to
    come ... not on Tuesday ... but on Wednesday at three o'clock, I shall
    be very glad to see you; and I, for one, shall have forgotten
    everything by that time; being quick at forgetting my own faults
    usually. If Wednesday does not suit you, I am not sure that I <i>can</i>
    see you this week&mdash;but it depends on circumstances. Only don't think
    yourself <i>obliged</i> to come on Wednesday. You know I <i>began</i> by
    entreating you to be open and sincere with me&mdash;and no more&mdash;I
    <i>require</i> no 'sleekening of every word.' I love the truth and can bear
    it&mdash;whether in word or deed&mdash;and those who have known me longest would
    tell you so fullest. Well!&mdash;May God bless you. We shall know each
    other some day perhaps&mdash;and I am

    Nay&mdash;I <i>must</i> have last word&mdash;as all people in the wrong desire to
    have&mdash;and then, no more of the subject. You said I had given you
    <i>great pain</i>&mdash;so long as I stop <i>that</i>, think anything of me you
    choose or can! But <i>before</i> your former letter came, I saw the

    from foolish self-relief, which, after all, I can do without)&mdash;and
    where there is <i>no</i> end&mdash;you see! or, to finish
    characteristically&mdash;since the offering to cut off one's right-hand to
    save anybody a headache, is in vile taste, even for our melodramas,
    seeing that it was never yet believed in on the stage or off it,&mdash;how
    much worse to really make the ugly chop, and afterwards come
    sheepishly in, one's arm in a black sling, and find that the
    delectable gift had changed aching to nausea! There! And now, 'exit,

</p>
<p>
    You will think me the most changeable of all the changeable; but
    indeed it is <i>not</i> my fault that I cannot, as I wished, receive you on
    Wednesday. There was a letter this morning; and our friends not only
    come to London but come to this house on Tuesday (to-morrow) to pass
    two or three days, until they settle in an hotel for the rest of the
    season. Therefore you see, it is doubtful whether the two days may not
    be three, and the three days four; but if they go away in time, and
    if Saturday should suit you, I will let you know by a word; and you
    can answer by a yea or nay. While they are in the house, I must give
    them what time I can&mdash;and indeed, it is something to dread altogether.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
    I send you the note I had begun before receiving yours of last night,
    and also a fragment<a href="#note-18"><b>18</b></a> from Mrs. Hedley's herein enclosed, a full and
    complete certificate, ... that you may know ... quite <i>know</i>, ... what
    the real and only reason of the obstacle to Wednesday is. On Saturday
    perhaps, or on Monday more certainly, there is likely to be no
    opposition, ... at least not on the 'côté gauche' (<i>my</i> side!) to our
    meeting&mdash;but I will let you know more.
</p>
<p>
    For the rest, we have both been a little unlucky, there's no denying,
    in overcoming the embarrassments of a first acquaintance&mdash;but suffer
    me to say as one other last word, (and <i>quite, quite the last this
    time</i>!) in case there should have been anything approaching, however
    remotely, to a distrustful or unkind tone in what I wrote on Sunday,
    (and I have a sort of consciousness that in the process of my
    self-scorning I was not in the most sabbatical of moods perhaps&mdash;)
    that I do recall and abjure it, and from my heart entreat your pardon
    for it, and profess, notwithstanding it, neither to 'choose' nor 'to
    be able' to think otherwise of you than I have done, ... as of one
    <i>most</i> generous and <i>most</i> loyal; for that if I chose, I could not;
    and that if I could, I should not choose.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever and gratefully your friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;And now we shall hear of 'Luria,' shall we not? and much besides.
    And Miss Mitford has sent me the most high comical of letters to
    read, addressed to her by 'R.B. Haydon historical painter' which has
    made me quite laugh; and would make <i>you</i>; expressing his righteous
    indignation at the 'great fact' and gross impropriety of any man who
    has 'thoughts too deep for tears' agreeing to wear a 'bag-wig' ... the
    case of poor Wordsworth's going to court, you know.&mdash;Mr. Haydon being
    infinitely serious all the time, and yet holding the doctrine of the
    divine right of princes in his left hand.
</p>
<p>
    How is your head? may I be hoping the best for it? May God bless you.

    Saturday, Monday, as you shall appoint&mdash;no need to say that, or my
    thanks&mdash;but this note troubles you, out of my bounden duty to help
    you, or Miss Mitford, to make the Painter run violently down a steep
    place into the sea, if that will amuse you, by further informing him,
    what I know on the best authority, that Wordsworth's 'bag-wig,' or at
    least, the more important of his court-habiliments, were considerately
    furnished for the nonce by <i>Mr. Rogers</i> from his own wardrobe, to the
    manifest advantage of the Laureate's pocket, but more problematic
    improvement of his person, when one thinks on the astounding
    difference of 'build' in the two Poets:&mdash;the fact should be put on
    record, if only as serving to render less chimerical a promise
    sometimes figuring in the columns of provincial newspapers&mdash;that the
    two apprentices, some grocer or other advertises for, will be 'boarded
    and <i>clothed</i> like <i>one</i> of the family.' May not your unfinished
    (really good) head of the great man have been happily kept waiting for
    the body which can now be added on, with all this picturesqueness of
    circumstances. Precept on precept ... but then, <i>line upon line</i>, is
    allowed by as good authority, and may I not draw <i>my</i> confirming black
    line after yours, yet not break pledge? I am most grateful to you for
    doing me justice&mdash;doing yourself, your own judgment, justice, since
    even the play-wright of Theseus and the Amazon found it one of his
    hardest devices to 'write me a speech, lest the lady be frightened,
    wherein it shall be said that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but &amp;c. &amp;c.'
    God bless you&mdash;one thing more, but one&mdash;you <i>could never have</i>
    misunderstood the <i>asking for the letter again</i>, I feared you might
    refer to it 'pour constater le fait'&mdash;

    Just one word to say that if Saturday, to-morrow, should be
    fine&mdash;because in the case of its raining I <i>shall not expect you</i>; you
    will find me at three o'clock.
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;the circumstances of the costume were mentioned in the letter;
    Mr. Rogers' bag-wig and the rest, and David Wilkie's sword&mdash;and also
    that the Laureate, so equipped, fell down upon both knees in the
    superfluity of etiquette, and had to be picked up by two
    lords-in-waiting. It is a large exaggeration I do not doubt&mdash;and then
    I never sympathised with the sighing kept up by people about that
    acceptance of the Laureateship which drew the bag-wig as a corollary
    after it. Not that the Laureateship honoured <i>him</i>, but that he
    honoured it; and that, so honouring it, he preserves a symbol
    instructive to the masses, who are children and to be taught by
    symbols now as formerly. Isn't it true? or at least may it not be
    true? And won't the court laurel (such as it is) be all the worthier
    of <i>you</i> for Wordsworth's having worn it first?

</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, June 7, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    When I see all you have done for me in this 'Prometheus,' I feel more
    than half ashamed both of it and of me for using your time so, and
    forced to say in my own defence (not to you but myself) that I never
    thought of meaning to inflict such work on you who might be doing so
    much better things in the meantime both for me and for
    others&mdash;because, you see, it is not the mere reading of the MS., but
    the 'comparing' of the text, and the melancholy comparisons between
    the English and the Greek, ... quite enough to turn you from your
    <span title="philanthrôpou tropou">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;</span><b><a href="#note-19">19</a></b> that I brought upon you; and indeed I
    did not mean so much, nor so soon! Yet as you have done it for me&mdash;for
    me who expected a few jottings down with a pencil and a general
    opinion; it is of course of the greatest value, besides the pleasure
    and pride which come of it; and I must say of the translation, (before
    putting it aside for the nonce), that the circumstance of your paying
    it so much attention and seeing any good in it, is quite enough reward
    for the writer and quite enough motive for self-gratulation, if it
    were all torn to fragments at this moment&mdash;which is a foolish thing to
    say because it is so obvious, and because you would know it if I said
    it or not.
</p>
<p>
    And while you were doing this for me, you thought it unkind of me not
    to write to you; yes, and you think me at this moment the very
    princess of apologies and excuses and depreciations and all the rest
    of the small family of distrust&mdash;or of hypocrisy ... who knows? Well!
    but you are wrong ... wrong ... to think so; and you will let me say
    one word to show where you are wrong&mdash;not for you to controvert, ...
    because it must relate to myself especially, and lies beyond your
    cognizance, and is something which I <i>must know best</i> after all. And
    it is, ... that you persist in putting me into a false position, with
    respect to <i>fixing days</i> and the like, and in making me feel somewhat
    as I did when I was a child, and Papa used to put me up on the
    chimney-piece and exhort me to stand up straight like a hero, which I
    did, straighter and straighter, and then suddenly 'was 'ware' (as we
    say in the ballads) of the walls' growing alive behind me and
    extending two stony hands to push me down that frightful precipice to
    the rug, where the dog lay ... dear old Havannah, ... and where he and
    I were likely to be dashed to pieces together and mix our uncanonised
    bones. Now my present false position ... which is not the
    chimney-piece's, ... is the necessity you provide for me in the shape
    of my having to name this day, or that day, ... and of your coming
    because I name it, and of my having to think and remember that you
    come because I name it. Through a weakness, perhaps, or morbidness, or
    one knows not how to define it, I <i>cannot help</i> being uncomfortable in
    having to do this,&mdash;it is impossible. Not that I distrust <i>you</i>&mdash;you
    are the last in the world I could distrust: and then (although you may
    be sceptical) I am naturally given to trust ... to a fault ... as some
    say, or to a sin, as some reproach me:&mdash;and then again, if I were ever
    such a distruster, it could not be of <i>you</i>. But if you knew me&mdash;! I
    will tell you! if one of my brothers omits coming to this room for two
    days, ... I never ask why it happened! if my own father omits coming
    up-stairs to say 'good night,' I never say a word; and not from
    indifference. Do try to make out these readings of me as a <i>dixit
    Casaubonus</i>; and don't throw me down as a corrupt text, nor convict me
    for an infidel which I am not. On the contrary I am grateful and happy
    to believe that you like to come here; and even if you came here as a
    pure act of charity and pity to me, as long as you <i>chose to come</i> I
    should not be too proud to be grateful and happy still. I could not be
    proud to <i>you</i>, and I hope you will not fancy such a possibility,
    which is the remotest of all. Yes, and <i>I</i> am anxious to ask you to be
    wholly generous and leave off such an interpreting philosophy as you
    made use of yesterday, and forgive me when I beg you to fix your own
    days for coming for the future. Will you? It is the same thing in one
    way. If you like to come really every week, there is no hindrance to
    it&mdash;you can do it&mdash;and the privilege and obligation remain equally
    mine:&mdash;and if you name a day for coming on any week, where there is an
    obstacle on my side, you will learn it from me in a moment. Why I
    might as well charge <i>you</i> with distrusting <i>me</i>, because you persist
    in making me choose the days. And it is not for me to do it, but for
    you&mdash;I must feel that&mdash;and I cannot help chafing myself against the
    thought that for me to begin to fix days in this way, just because you
    have quick impulses (like all imaginative persons), and wish me to do
    it now, may bring me to the catastrophe of asking you to come when you
    would rather not, ... which, as you say truly, would not be an
    important vexation to you; but to me would be worse than vexation; to
    <i>me</i>&mdash;and therefore I shrink from the very imagination of the
    possibility of such a thing, and ask you to bear with me and let it be
    as I prefer ... left to your own choice of the moment. And bear with
    me above all&mdash;because this shows no want of faith in you ... none ...
    but comes from a simple fact (with its ramifications) ... that you
    know little of me personally yet, and that <i>you guess</i>, even, but very
    little of the influence of a peculiar experience over me and out of
    me; and if I wanted a proof of this, we need not seek further than the
    very point of discussion, and the hard worldly thoughts you thought I
    was thinking of you yesterday,&mdash;I, who thought not one of them! But I
    am so used to discern the correcting and ministering angels by the
    same footsteps on the ground, that it is not wonderful I should look
    down there at any approach of a <span title="philia taxis">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&alpha; &tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> whatever to this
    personal <i>me</i>. Have I not been ground down to browns and blacks? and
    is it my fault if I am not green? Not that it is my <i>complaint</i>&mdash;I
    should not be justified in complaining; I believe, as I told you, that
    there is more gladness than sadness in the world&mdash;that is, generally:
    and if some natures have to be refined by the sun, and some by the
    furnace (the less genial ones) both means are to be recognised as
    <i>good</i>, ... however different in pleasurableness and painfulness, and
    though furnace-fire leaves scorched streaks upon the fruit. I assured
    you there was nothing I had any power of teaching you: and there <i>is</i>
    nothing, except grief!&mdash;which I would not teach you, you know, if I
    had the occasion granted.
</p>
<p>
    It is a multitude of words about nothing at all, ... this&mdash;but I am
    like Mariana in the moated grange and sit listening too often to the
    mouse in the wainscot. Be as forbearing as you can&mdash;and believe how
    profoundly it touches me that you should care to come here at all,
    much more, so often! and try to understand that if I did not write as
    you half asked, it was just because I failed at the moment to get up
    enough pomp and circumstance to write on purpose to certify the
    important fact of my being a little stronger or a little weaker on one
    particular morning. That I am always ready and rejoiced to write to
    you, you know perfectly well, and I have proved, by 'superfluity of
    naughtiness' and prolixity through some twenty posts:&mdash;and this, and
    therefore, you will agree altogether to attribute no more to me on
    these counts, and determine to read me no more backwards with your
    Hebrew, putting in your own vowel points without my leave! Shall it be
    so?
</p>
<p>
    Here is a letter grown from a note which it meant to be&mdash;and I have
    been interrupted in the midst of it, or it should have gone to you
    earlier. Let what I have said in it of myself pass unquestioned and
    unnoticed, because it is of <i>me</i> and not of <i>you</i>, ... and, if in any
    wise lunatical, all the talking and writing in the world will not put
    the implied moon into another quarter. Only be patient with me a
    little, ... and let us have a smooth ground for the poems which I am
    foreseeing the sight of with such pride and delight&mdash;Such pride and
    delight!
</p>
<p>
    And one thing ... which is chief, though it seems to come last!... you
    <i>will</i> have advice (will you not?) if that pain does not grow much
    better directly? It cannot be prudent or even <i>safe</i> to let a pain in
    the head go on so long, and no remedy be attempted for it, ... and you
    cannot be sure that it is a merely nervous pain and that it may not
    have consequences; and this, quite apart from the consideration of
    suffering. So you will see some one with an opinion to give, and take
    it? <i>Do</i>, I beseech you. You will not say 'no'? Also ... if on
    Wednesday you should be less well than usual, you will come on
    Thursday instead, I hope, ... seeing that it must be right for you to
    be quiet and silent when you suffer so, and a journey into London can
    let you be neither. Otherwise, I hold to my day, ... Wednesday. And
    may God bless you my dear friend.

<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, June 7, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I ventured to hope this morning might bring me news of you&mdash;First
    East-winds on you, then myself, then those criticisms!&mdash;I do assure
    you I am properly apprehensive. How are you? May I go on Wednesday
    without too much <span title="anthadia">&alpha;&nu;&theta;&alpha;&delta;&iota;&alpha;</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Pray remember what I said and wrote, to the effect that my exceptions
    were, in almost every case, to the 'reading'&mdash;not to your version of
    it: but I have not specified the particular ones&mdash;not written down the
    Greek, of my suggested translations&mdash;have I? And if you do not find
    them in the margin of your copy, how you must wonder! Thus, in the
    last speech but one, of Hermes, I prefer Porson and Blomfield's
    <span title="ei mêd' atychôn ti chala maniôn">&epsilon;&iota; &mu;&eta;&delta;' &alpha;&tau;&upsilon;&chi;&omega;&nu; &tau;&iota; &chi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha; &mu;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&omega;&nu;</span>;&mdash;to the old combinations
    that include <span title="eutychê">&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;&upsilon;&chi;&eta;</span>&mdash;though there is no MS. authority for
    emendation, it seems. But in what respect does Prometheus 'fare
    <i>well</i>,' or 'better' even, since the beginning? And is it not the old
    argument over again, that when a man <i>fails</i> he should repent of his
    ways?&mdash;And while thinking of Hermes, let me say that '<span title="mêde moi diplas odous prosbalês">&mu;&eta;&delta;&epsilon; &mu;&omicron;&iota; &delta;&iota;&pi;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf; &omicron;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>' is surely&mdash;'Don't subject me to the trouble
    of a second journey ... by paying no attention to the first.' So says
    Scholiast A, and so backs him Scholiast B, especially created, it
    should appear, to show there could be <i>in rerum naturâ</i> such another
    as his predecessor. A few other remarks occur to me, which I will tell
    you if you please; <i>now</i>, I really want to know how you are, and write
    for that.

</p>
<p>
    Just after my note left, yours came&mdash;I will try so to answer it as to
    please you; and I begin by promising cheerfully to do all you bid me
    about naming days &amp;c. I do believe we are friends now and for ever.
    There can be no reason, therefore, that I should cling tenaciously to
    any one or other time of meeting, as if, losing that, I lost
    everything&mdash;and, for the future, I will provide against sudden
    engagements, outrageous weather &amp;c., to your heart's content. Nor am I
    going to except against here and there a little wrong I could get up,
    as when you <i>imply</i> from my quick impulses and the like. No, my dear
    friend&mdash;for I seem sure I shall have quite, quite time enough to do
    myself justice in your eyes&mdash;Let time show!
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps I feel none the less sorely, when you 'thank' me for such
    company as mine, that I cannot avoid confessing to myself that it
    would not be so absolutely out of my power, perhaps, to contrive
    really and deserve thanks in a certain acceptation&mdash;I <i>might</i> really
    <i>try</i>, at all events, and amuse you a little better, when I do have
    the opportunity,&mdash;and I <i>do not</i>&mdash;but there is the thing! It is all of
    a piece&mdash;I <i>do not</i> seek your friendship in order to do you good&mdash;any
    good&mdash;only to do myself good. Though I <i>would</i>, God knows, do that
    too.
</p>
<p>
    Enough of this.
</p>
<p>
    I am much better, indeed,&mdash;but will certainly follow your advice
    should the pain return. And you&mdash;you have tried a new journey from
    your room, have you not?
</p>
<p>
    Do recollect, at any turn, any chance so far in my favour,&mdash;that I am
    here and yours should you want any fetching and carrying in this
    outside London world. Your brothers may have their own business to
    mind, Mr. Kenyon is at New York, we will suppose; here am I&mdash;what
    else, <i>what else</i> makes me count my cleverness to you, as I know I
    have done more than once, by word and letter, but the real wish to be
    set at work? I should have, I hope, better taste than to tell any
    everyday acquaintance, who could not go out, one single morning even,
    on account of a headache, that the weather was delightful, much less
    that I had been walking five miles and meant to run ten&mdash;yet to you I
    boasted once of polking and waltzing and more&mdash;but then would it not
    be a very superfluous piece of respect in the four-footed bird to keep
    his wings to himself because his Master Oceanos could fly forsooth?
    Whereas he begins to wave a flap and show how ready they are to be
    off&mdash;for what else were the good of him? Think of this&mdash;and

    Oh, let me tell you&mdash;I suppose Mr. Horne must be in town&mdash;as I
    received a letter two days ago, from the contriver of some literary

    protesting <i>against</i> my reasons for refusing, and begging that 'at all
    events I would suspend my determination till I had been visited by Mr.
    H. on the subject'&mdash;and, as they can hardly mean to bring him express
    from the Drachenfels for just that, he is returned no doubt&mdash;and as he
    is your friend, I take the opportunity of mentioning the course I
    shall pursue with him or any other friend of yours I may meet,&mdash;(and
    everybody else, I may add&mdash;) the course I understand you to desire,
    with respect to our own intimacy. While I may acknowledge, I believe,
    that I correspond with you, I shall not, in any case, suffer it to be

</p>
<p>
    I must thank you by one word for all your kindness and
    consideration&mdash;which could not be greater; nor more felt by me. In the
    first place, afterwards (if that should not be Irish dialect) do
    understand that my letter passed from my hands to go to yours on
    <i>Friday</i>, but was thrown aside carelessly down stairs and 'covered up'
    they say, so as not to be seen until late on Saturday; and I can only
    humbly hope to have been cross enough about it (having conscientiously
    tried) to secure a little more accuracy another time.&mdash;And then, ...
    if ever I should want anything done or found, ... (a roc's egg or the
    like) you may believe me that I shall not scruple to ask you to be the
    finder; but at this moment I want nothing, indeed, except your poems;
    and that is quite the truth. Now do consider and think what I could
    possibly want in your 'outside London world'; you, who are the 'Genius
    of the lamp'!&mdash;Why if you light it and let me read your romances, &amp;c.,
    by it, is not that the best use for it, and am I likely to look for
    another? Only I shall remember what you say, gratefully and seriously;
    and if ever I should have a good fair opportunity of giving you
    trouble (as if I had not done it already!), you may rely upon my evil
    intentions; even though dear Mr. Kenyon should not actually be at New
    York, ... which he is not, I am glad to say, as I saw him on Saturday.
</p>
<p>
    Which reminds me that <i>he</i> knows of your having been here, of course!
    and will not mention it; as he understood from me that <i>you</i> would
    not.&mdash;Thank you! Also there was an especial reason which constrained
    me, on pain of appearing a great hypocrite, to tell Miss Mitford the
    bare fact of my having seen you&mdash;and reluctantly I did it, though
    placing some hope in her promise of discretion. And how necessary the
    discretion is, will appear in the awful statistical fact of our having
    at this moment, as my sisters were calculating yesterday, some forty
    relations in London&mdash;to say nothing of the right wing of the enemy.
    For Mr. Horne, I could have told you, and really I thought I <i>had</i>
    told you of his being in England.
</p>
<p>
    Last paragraph of all is, that I <i>don't want to be amused</i>, ... or
    rather that I <i>am</i> amused by everything and anything. Why surely,
    surely, you have some singular ideas about me! So, till to-morrow,

<p>
    Yes, the poem <i>is</i> too good in certain respects for the prizes given
    in colleges, (when all the pure parsley goes naturally to the
    rabbits), and has a great deal of beauty here and there in image and
    expression. Still I do not quite agree with you that it reaches the
    Tennyson standard any wise; and for the blank verse, I cannot for a
    moment think it comparable to one of the grand passages in 'Oenone,'
    and 'Arthur' and the like. In fact I seem to hear more in that latter
    blank verse than you do, ... to hear not only a 'mighty line' as in
    Marlowe, but a noble full orbicular wholeness in complete
    passages&mdash;which always struck me as the mystery of music and great
    peculiarity in Tennyson's versification, inasmuch as he attains to
    these complete effects without that shifting of the pause practised by
    the masters, ... Shelley and others. A 'linked music' in which there
    are no links!&mdash;<i>that</i>, you would take to be a contradiction&mdash;and yet
    something like that, my ear has always seemed to perceive; and I have
    wondered curiously again and again how there could be so much union
    and no fastening. Only of course it is not model versification&mdash;and
    for dramatic purposes, it must be admitted to be bad.
</p>
<p>
    Which reminds me to be astonished for the second time how you could
    think such a thing of me as that I wanted to read only your lyrics,
    ... or that I 'preferred the lyrics' ... or something barbarous in
    that way? You don't think me 'ambidexter,' or 'either-handed' ... and
    both hands open for what poems you will vouchsafe to me; and yet if
    you would let me see anything you may have in a readable state by you,
    ... 'The Flight of the Duchess' ... or act or scene of 'The Soul's
    Tragedy,' ... I shall be so glad and grateful to you! Oh&mdash;if you
    change your mind and choose to be <i>bien prié</i>, I will grant it is your
    right, and begin my liturgy directly. But this is not teazing (in the
    intention of it!) and I understand all about the transcription, and
    the inscrutableness of rough copies,&mdash;that is, if you write as I do,
    so that my guardian angel or M. Champollion cannot read what is
    written. Only whatever they can, (remember!) <i>I</i> can: and you are not
    to mind trusting me with the cacistography possible to mortal readers.

<p>
    When I ask my wise self what I really do remember of the Prize poem,
    the answer is&mdash;both of Chapman's lines a-top, quite worth any prize
    for their quoter&mdash;then, the good epithet of 'Green Europe' contrasting
    with Africa&mdash;then, deep in the piece, a picture of a Vestal in a
    vault, where I see a dipping and winking lamp plainest, and last of
    all the ominous 'all was dark' that dismisses you. I read the poem
    many years ago, and never since, though I have an impression that the
    versification is good, yet from your commentary I see I must have said
    a good deal more in its praise than that. But have you not discovered
    by this time that I go on talking with my thoughts away?
</p>
<p>
    I know, I have always been jealous of my own musical faculty (I can
    write music).&mdash;Now that I see the uselessness of such jealousy, and am
    for loosing and letting it go, it may be cramped possibly. Your music
    is more various and exquisite than any modern writer's to my ear. One
    should study the mechanical part of the art, as nearly all that there
    is to be studied&mdash;for the more one sits and thinks over the creative
    process, the more it confirms itself as 'inspiration,' nothing more
    nor less. Or, at worst, you write down old inspirations, what you
    remember of them ... but with <i>that</i> it begins. 'Reflection' is
    exactly what it names itself&mdash;a <i>re</i>-presentation, in scattered rays
    from every angle of incidence, of what first of all became present in
    a great light, a whole one. So tell me how these lights are born, if
    you can! But I can tell anybody how to make melodious verses&mdash;let him
    do it therefore&mdash;it should be exacted of all writers.
</p>
<p>
    You do not understand what a new feeling it is for me to have someone
    who is to like my verses or I shall not ever like them after! So far
    differently was I circumstanced of old, that I used rather to go about
    for a subject of offence to people; writing ugly things in order to
    warn the ungenial and timorous off my grounds at once. I shall never
    do so again at least! As it is, I will bring all I dare, in as great
    quantities as I can&mdash;if not next time, after then&mdash;certainly. I must
    make an end, print this Autumn my last four 'Bells,' Lyrics, Romances,
    'The Tragedy,' and 'Luna,' and then go on with a whole heart to my own
    Poem&mdash;indeed, I have just resolved not to begin any new song, even,
    till this grand clearance is made&mdash;I will get the Tragedy transcribed
    to bring&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    'To bring!' Next Wednesday&mdash;if you know how happy you make me! may I
    not say <i>that</i>, my dear friend, when I feel it from my soul?
</p>
<p>
    I thank God that you are better: do pray make fresh endeavours to
    profit by this partial respite of the weather! All about you must urge
    that: but even from my distance some effect might come of such wishes.
    But you <i>are</i> better&mdash;look so and speak so! God bless you.

<p>
    Yes, I quite believe as you do that what is called the 'creative
    process' in works of Art, is just inspiration and no less&mdash;which made
    somebody say to me not long since; And so you think that Shakespeare's
    'Othello' was of the effluence of the Holy Ghost?'&mdash;rather a startling
    deduction, ... only not quite as final as might appear to somebodies
    perhaps. At least it does not prevent my going on to agree with the
    saying of <i>Spiridion</i>, ... do you remember?... 'Tout ce que l'homme
    appelle inspiration, je l'appelle aussi revelation,' ... if there is
    not something too self-evident in it after all&mdash;my sole objection! And
    is it not true that your inability to analyse the mental process in
    question, is one of the proofs of the fact of inspiration?&mdash;as the
    gods were known of old by not being seen to move their feet,&mdash;coming
    and going in an equal sweep of radiance.&mdash;And still more wonderful
    than the first transient great light you speak of, ... and far beyond
    any work of <i>re</i>flection, except in the pure analytical sense in which
    you use the word, ... appears that gathering of light on light upon
    particular points, as you go (in composition) step by step, till you
    get intimately near to things, and see them in a fullness and
    clearness, and an intense trust in the truth of them which you have
    not in any sunshine of noon (called <i>real</i>!) but which you have <i>then</i>
    ... and struggle to communicate:&mdash;an ineffectual struggle with most
    writers (oh, how ineffectual!) and when effectual, issuing in the
    'Pippa Passes,' and other master-pieces of the world.
</p>
<p>
    You will tell me what you mean exactly by being jealous of your own
    music? You said once that you had had a false notion of music, or had
    practised it according to the false notions of other people: but did
    you mean besides that you ever had meant to despise music
    altogether&mdash;because <i>that</i>, it is hard to set about trying to believe
    of you indeed. And then, you <i>can</i> praise my verses for music?&mdash;Why,
    are you aware that people blame me constantly for wanting
    harmony&mdash;from Mr. Boyd who moans aloud over the indisposition of my
    'trochees' ... and no less a person than Mr. Tennyson, who said to
    somebody who repeated it, that in the want of harmony lay the chief
    defect of the poems, 'although it might verily be retrieved, as he
    could fancy that I had an ear by nature.' Well&mdash;but I am pleased that
    you should praise me&mdash;right or wrong&mdash;I mean, whether I am right or
    wrong in being pleased! and I say so to you openly, although my belief
    is that you are under a vow to our Lady of Loretto to make giddy with
    all manner of high vanities, some head, ... not too strong for such
    things, but too low for them, ... before you see again the embroidery
    on her divine petticoat. Only there's a flattery so far beyond praise
    ... even <i>your</i> praise&mdash;as where you talk of your verses being liked
    &amp;c., and of your being happy to bring them here, ... that is scarcely
    a lawful weapon; and see if the Madonna may not signify so much to
    you!&mdash;Seriously, you will not hurry too uncomfortably, or
    uncomfortably at all, about the transcribing? Another day, you know,
    will do as well&mdash;and patience is possible to me, if not 'native to the
    soil.'
</p>
<p>
    Also I am behaving very well in going out into the noise; not quite
    out of doors yet, on account of the heat&mdash;and I am better as you say,
    without any doubt at all, and stronger&mdash;only my looks are a little
    deceitful; and people are apt to be heated and flushed in this
    weather, one hour, to look a little more ghastly an hour or two after.
    Not that it <i>is</i> not true of me that I am better, mind! Because I am.
</p>
<p>
    The 'flower in the letter' was from one of my sisters&mdash;from Arabel
    (though many of these poems are <i>ideal</i> ... will you understand?) and
    your rose came quite alive and fresh, though in act of dropping its
    beautiful leaves, because of having to come to me instead of living on
    in your garden, as it intended. But I thank you&mdash;for this, and all, my

    When I next see you, do not let me go on and on to my confusion about
    matters I am more or less ignorant of, but always ignorant. I tell
    you plainly I only trench on them, and intrench in them, from
    gaucherie, pure and respectable ... I should certainly grow
    instructive on the prospects of hay-crops and pasture-land, if
    deprived of this resource. And now here is a week to wait before I
    shall have any occasion to relapse into Greek literature when I am
    thinking all the while, 'now I will just ask simply, what flattery
    there was,' &amp;c. &amp;c., which, as I had not courage to say then, I keep
    to myself for shame now. This I will say, then&mdash;wait and know me
    better, as you will one long day at the end.
</p>
<p>
    Why I write now, is because you did not promise, as before, to let me

</p>
<p>
    If on Greek literature or anything else it is your pleasure to
    cultivate a reputation for ignorance, I will respect your desire&mdash;and
    indeed the point of the deficiency in question being far above my
    sight I am not qualified either to deny or assert the existence of it;
    so you are free to have it all your own way.
</p>
<p>
    About the 'flattery' however, there is a difference; and I must deny a
    little having ever used such a word ... as far as I can recollect, and
    I have been trying to recollect, ... as that word of flattery. Perhaps
    I said something about your having vowed to make me vain by writing
    this or that of my liking your verses and so on&mdash;and perhaps I said it
    too lightly ... which happened because when one doesn't know whether
    to laugh or to cry, it is far best, as a general rule, to laugh. But
    the serious truth is that it was all nonsense together what I wrote,
    and that, instead of talking of your making me vain, I should have
    talked (if it had been done sincerely) of your humbling me&mdash;inasmuch
    as nothing does humble anybody so much as being lifted up too high.
    You know what vaulting Ambition did once for himself? and when it is
    done for him by another, his fall is still heavier. And one moral of
    all this general philosophy is, that if when your poems come, you
    persist in giving too much importance to what I may have courage to
    say of this or of that in them, you will make me a dumb critic and I
    shall have no help for my dumbness. So I tell you beforehand&mdash;nothing
    extenuating nor exaggerating nor putting down in malice. I know so
    much of myself as to be sure of it. Even as it is, the 'insolence'
    which people blame me for and praise me for, ... the 'recklessness'
    which my friends talk of with mitigating countenances ... seems
    gradually going and going&mdash;and really it would not be very strange
    (without that) if <i>I</i> who was born a hero worshipper and have so
    continued, and who always recognised your genius, should find it
    impossible to bring out critical doxies on the workings of it. Well&mdash;I
    shall do what I can&mdash;as far as <i>impressions</i> go, you understand&mdash;and
    <i>you</i> must promise not to attach too much importance to anything said.
    So that is a covenant, my dear friend!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And I am really gaining strength&mdash;and I will not complain of the
    weather. As long as the thermometer keeps above sixty I am content for
    one; and the roses are not quite dead yet, which they would have been
    in the heat. And last and not least&mdash;may I ask if you were told that
    the pain in the head was not important (or was) in the causes, ... and
    was likely to be well soon? or was not? I am at the end.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.

</p>
<p>
    And if I am 'suspicious of your suspiciousness,' who gives cause,
    pray? The matter was long ago settled, I thought, when you first took
    exception to what I said about higher and lower, and I consented to
    this much&mdash;that you should help seeing, if you could, our true
    intellectual and moral relation each to the other, so long as you
    would allow <i>me</i> to see what <i>is</i> there, fronting me. 'Is my eye evil
    because yours is not good?' My own friend, if I wished to 'make you
    vain,' if having 'found the Bower' I did really address myself to the
    wise business of spoiling its rose-roof,&mdash;I think that at least where
    there was such a will, there would be also something not unlike a
    way,&mdash;that I should find a proper hooked stick to tear down flowers
    with, and write you other letters than these&mdash;quite, quite others, I
    feel&mdash;though I am far from going to imagine, even for a moment, what
    might be the precise prodigy&mdash;like the notable Son of Zeus, that <i>was</i>
    to have been, and done the wonders, only he did not, because &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    But I have a restless head to-day, and so let you off easily. Well,
    you ask me about it, that head, and I am not justified in being
    positive when my Doctor is dubious; as for the causes, they are
    neither superfluity of study, nor fancy, nor care, nor any special
    naughtiness that I know how to amend. So if I bring you 'nothing to
    signify' on Wednesday ... though I hope to do more than that ... you
    will know exactly why it happens. I will finish and transcribe the
    'Flight of the Duchess' since you spoke of that first.

    I had begun to be afraid that I did not deserve to have my questions
    answered; and I was afraid of asking them over again. But it is worse
    to be afraid that you are not better at all in any essential manner
    (after all your assurances) and that the medical means have failed so
    far. Did you go to somebody who knows anything?&mdash;because there is no
    excuse, you see, in common sense, for not having the best and most
    experienced opinion when there is a choice of advice&mdash;and I am
    confident that that pain should not be suffered to go on without
    something being done. What I said about <i>nerves</i>, related to what you
    had told me of your mother's suffering and what you had fancied of the
    relation of it to your own, and not that I could be thinking about
    imaginary complaints&mdash;I wish I could. Not (either) that I believe in
    the relation ... because such things are not hereditary, are they? and
    the bare coincidence is improbable. Well, but, I wanted particularly
    to say this&mdash;<i>Don't bring the 'Duchess' with you on Wednesday.</i> I
    shall not expect anything, I write distinctly to tell you&mdash;and I would
    far far rather that you did not bring it. You see it is just as I
    thought&mdash;for that whether too much thought or study did or did not
    bring on the illness, ... yet you admit that reading and writing
    increase it ... as they would naturally do any sort of pain in the
    head&mdash;therefore if you will but be in earnest and try to get well
    <i>first</i>, we will do the 'Bells' afterwards, and there will be time for
    a whole peal of them, I hope and trust, before the winter. Now do
    admit that this is reasonable, and agree reasonably to it. And if it
    does you good to go out and take exercise, why not go out and take it?
    nay, why not go <i>away</i> and take it? Why not try the effect of a little
    change of air&mdash;or even of a great change of air&mdash;if it should be
    necessary, or even expedient? Anything is better, you know ... or if
    you don't know, <i>I</i> know&mdash;than to be ill, really, seriously&mdash;I mean
    for <i>you</i> to be ill, who have so much to do and to enjoy in the world
    yet ... and all those bells waiting to be hung! So that if you will
    agree to be well first, I will promise to be ready afterwards to help
    you in any thing I can do ... transcribing or anything ... to get the
    books through the press in the shortest of times&mdash;and I am capable of
    a great deal of that sort of work without being tired, having the
    habit of writing in any sort of position, and the long habit, ...
    since, before I was ill even, I never used to write at a table (or
    scarcely ever) but on the arm of a chair, or on the seat of one,
    sitting myself on the floor, and calling myself a Lollard for dignity.
    So you will put by your 'Duchess' ... will you not? or let me see just
    that one sheet&mdash;if one should be written&mdash;which is finished? ... up to
    this moment, you understand? finished <i>now</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And if I have tired and teazed you with all these words it is a bad
    opportunity to take&mdash;and yet I will persist in saying through good and
    bad opportunities that I never did 'give cause' as you say, to your
    being 'suspicious of my suspiciousness' as I believe I said before. I
    deny my 'suspiciousness' altogether&mdash;it is not one of my faults. Nor
    is it quite my fault that you and I should always be quarrelling about
    over-appreciations and under-appreciations&mdash;and after all I have no
    interest nor wish, I do assure you, to depreciate myself&mdash;and you are
    not to think that I have the remotest claim to the Monthyon prize for
    good deeds in the way of modesty of self-estimation. Only when I know
    you better, as you talk of ... and when <i>you</i> know <i>me</i> too well, ...
    the right and the wrong of these conclusions will appear in a fuller
    light than ever so much arguing can produce now. Is it unkindly
    written of me? <i>no</i>&mdash;I <i>feel</i> it is not!&mdash;and that 'now and ever we
    are friends,' (just as you think) <i>I</i> think besides and am happy in
    thinking so, and could not be distrustful of you if I tried. So may
    God bless you, my ever dear friend&mdash;and mind to forget the 'Duchess'
    and to remember every good counsel!&mdash;Not that I do particularly
    confide in the medical oracles. They never did much more for <i>me</i>
    than, when my pulse was above a hundred and forty with fever, to give
    me digitalis to make me weak&mdash;and, when I could not move without
    fainting (with weakness), to give me quinine to make me feverish
    again. Yes&mdash;and they could tell from the stethoscope, how very little
    was really wrong in me ... if it were not on a vital organ&mdash;and how I
    should certainly live ... if I didn't die sooner. But then, nothing
    <i>has</i> power over affections of the chest, except God and his
    winds&mdash;and I do hope that an obvious quick remedy may be found for
    your head. But <i>do</i> give up the writing and all that does harm!&mdash;

    was entirely her proposition and not mine, and that certainly it won't
    be acceded to, as far as <i>I</i> am concerned; as I have explained to her
    finally. I have been vexed about it&mdash;but she can see him down-stairs

    I have waited hour after hour, hoping to hear from Miss Mitford that

    I begin to wonder whether she can have received my letter at all, or
    whether she may not have been vexed by it into taking a vengeance and
    adhering to her own devices; (for it appealed to her esprit de sexe on
    the undeniable axiom of women having their way ... and she might
    choose to act it out!) just as I wonder over all this, and consider
    what a confusion of the elements it would be if you came and found her
    here, and Mr. Chorley at the door perhaps, waiting for some of the
    light of her countenance;&mdash;comes a note from Mr. Kenyon, to the
    effect that <i>he</i> will be here at four o'clock P.M.&mdash;and comes a final

    away the doubt about Miss Mitford, and Mr. Kenyon remains&mdash;and take
    away Mr. Kenyon, and there is Mrs. Hedley&mdash;and thus it <i>must be for
    Friday</i> ... which will learn to be a fortunate day for the
    nonce&mdash;unless Saturday should suit you better. I do not speak of
    Thursday, because of the doubt about Miss Mitford&mdash;and if any harm
    should happen to Friday, I will write again; but if you do not hear
    again, and are able to come then, you <i>will</i> come perhaps then.
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime I thank you for the better news in your note&mdash;if it is
    really, really to be trusted in&mdash;but you know, you have said so often
    that you were better and better, without being really better, that it
    makes people ... 'suspicious.' Yet it is full amends for the
    disappointment to hope ... here I must break off or be too late. May
    God bless you my dear friend.

    Well&mdash;Saturday is said&mdash;but I will stay not quite so long, nor talk

    I send back the prize poems which have been kept far too long even if
    I do not make excuses for the keeping&mdash;but our sins are not always to
    be measured by our repentance for them. Then I am well enough this
    morning to have thought of going out till they told me it was not at
    all a right day for it ... too windy ... soft and delightful as the
    air seems to be&mdash;particularly after yesterday, when we had some winter
    back again in an episode. And the roses do not die; which is quite
    magnanimous of them considering their reverses; and their buds are
    coming out in most exemplary resignation&mdash;like birds singing in a
    cage. Now that the windows may be open, the flowers take heart to live
    a little in this room.
</p>
<p>
    And think of my forgetting to tell you on Saturday that I had known of
    a letter being received by somebody from Miss Martineau, who is at
    Ambleside at this time and so entranced with the lakes and mountains
    as to be dreaming of taking or making a house among them, to live in
    for the rest of her life. Mrs. Trollope, you may have heard, had
    something of the same nympholepsy&mdash;no, her daughter was 'settled' in
    the neighbourhood&mdash;<i>that</i> is the more likely reason for Mrs. Trollope!
    and the spirits of the hills conspired against her the first winter
    and almost slew her with a fog and drove her away to your Italy where
    the Oreadocracy has gentler manners. And Miss Martineau is practising
    mesmerism and miracles on all sides she says, and counts on Archbishop
    Whately as a new adherent. I even fancy that he has been to see her in
    the character of a convert. All this from Mr. Kenyon.
</p>
<p>
    There's a strange wild book called the Autobiography of Heinrich
    Stilling ... one of those true devout deep-hearted Germans who believe
    everything, and so are nearer the truth, I am sure, than the wise who
    believe nothing; but rather over-German sometimes, and redolent of
    sauerkraut&mdash;and <i>he</i> gives a tradition ... somewhere between mesmerism
    and mysticism, ... of a little spirit with gold shoebuckles, who was
    his familiar spirit and appeared only in the sunshine I think ...
    mottling it over with its feet, perhaps, as a child might snow. Take
    away the shoebuckles and I believe in the little spirit&mdash;don't <i>you</i>?
    But these English mesmerists make the shoebuckles quite conspicuous
    and insist on them broadly; and the Archbishops Whately may be drawn
    by <i>them</i> (who can tell?) more than by the little spirit itself. How
    is your head to-day? now really, and nothing extenuating? I will not
    ask of poems, till the 'quite well' is <i>authentic</i>. May God bless you
    always! my dear friend!
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.

    After all the book must go another day. I live in chaos do you know?
    and I am too hurried at this moment ... yes it is here.

    How are you&mdash;may I hope to hear soon?
</p>
<p>
    I don't know exactly what possessed me to set my next day so far off
    as Saturday&mdash;as it was said, however, so let it be. And I will bring
    the rest of the 'Duchess'&mdash;four or five hundred lines,&mdash;'heu, herba
    mala crescit'&mdash;(as I once saw mournfully pencilled on a white wall at
    Asolo)&mdash;but will you tell me if you quite remember the main of the
    <i>first</i> part&mdash;(<i>parts</i> there are none except in the necessary process
    of chopping up to suit the limits of a magazine&mdash;and I gave them as
    much as I could transcribe at a sudden warning)&mdash;because, if you
    please, I can bring the whole, of course.
</p>
<p>
    After seeing <i>you</i>, that Saturday, I was caught up by a friend and
    carried to see Vidocq&mdash;who did the honours of his museum of knives and
    nails and hooks that have helped great murderers to their purposes&mdash;he
    scarcely admits, I observe, an implement with only one attestation to
    its efficacy; but the one or two exceptions rather justify his
    latitude in their favour&mdash;thus one little sort of dessert knife <i>did</i>
    only take <i>one</i> life.... 'But then,' says Vidocq, 'it was the man's
    own mother's life, with fifty-two blows, and all for' (I think)
    'fifteen francs she had got?' So prattles good-naturedly Vidocq&mdash;one
    of his best stories of that Lacénaire&mdash;'jeune homme d'un caractère
    fort avenant&mdash;mais c'était un poète,' quoth he, turning sharp on <i>me</i>
    out of two or three other people round him.
</p>
<p>
    Here your letter breaks in, and sunshine too.
</p>
<p>
    Why do you send me that book&mdash;not let me take it? What trouble for
    nothing!
</p>
<p>
    An old French friend of mine, a dear foolish, very French heart and
    soul, is coming presently&mdash;his poor brains are whirling with mesmerism
    in which he believes, as in all other unbelief. He and I are to dine
    alone (I have not seen him these two years)&mdash;and I shall never be able
    to keep from driving the great wedge right through his breast and
    descending lower, from riveting his two foolish legs to the wintry
    chasm; for I that stammer and answer hap-hazard with you, get
    proportionately valiant and voluble with a mere cupful of Diderot's
    rinsings, and a man into the bargain.
</p>
<p>
    If you were prevented from leaving the house yesterday, assuredly
    to-day you will never attempt such a thing&mdash;the wind, rain&mdash;all is
    against it: I trust you will not make the first experiment except
    under really favourable auspices ... for by its success you will
    naturally be induced to go on or leave off&mdash;Still you are <i>better</i>! I
    fully believe, dare to believe, <i>that</i> will continue. As for me, since
    you ask&mdash;find me but something <i>to do</i>, and see if I shall not be
    well!&mdash;Though I <i>am</i> well now almost.
</p>
<p>
    How good you are to my roses&mdash;they are not of my making, to be sure.
    Never, by the way, did Miss Martineau work such a miracle as I now
    witness in the garden&mdash;I gathered at Rome, close to the fountain of
    Egeria, a handful of <i>fennel</i>-seeds from the most indisputable plant
    of fennel I ever chanced upon&mdash;and, lo, they are come up ... hemlock,
    or something akin! In two places, moreover. Wherein does hemlock
    resemble fennel? How could I mistake? No wonder that a stone's cast
    off from that Egeria's fountain is the Temple of the God Ridiculus.
</p>
<p>
    Well, on Saturday then&mdash;at three: and I will certainly bring the
    verses you mention&mdash;and trust to find you still better.

<p>
    Yes&mdash;I know the first part of the 'Duchess' and have it here&mdash;and for
    the rest of the poem, don't mind about being very legible, or even
    legible in the usual sense; and remember how it is my boast to be able
    to read all such manuscript writing as never is read by people who
    don't like caviare. Now you won't mind? really I rather like blots
    than otherwise&mdash;being a sort of patron-saint of all manner of
    untidyness ... if Mr. Kenyon's reproaches (of which there's a
    stereotyped edition) are justified by the fact&mdash;and he has a great
    organ of order, and knows 'disorderly persons' at a glance, I suppose.
    But you won't be particular with <i>me</i> in the matter of transcription?
    <i>that</i> is what I want to make sure of. And even if you are not
    particular, I am afraid you are not well enough to be troubled by
    writing, and writing and the thinking that comes with it&mdash;it would be
    wiser to wait till you are quite well&mdash;now wouldn't it?&mdash;and my fear
    is that the 'almost well' means 'very little better.' And why, when
    there is no motive for hurrying, run any risk? Don't think that I will
    help you to make yourself ill. That I refuse to do even so much work
    as the 'little dessert-knife' in the way of murder, ... <i>do</i> think! So
    upon the whole, I expect nothing on Saturday from this distance&mdash;and
    if it comes unexpectedly (I mean the Duchess and not Saturday) <i>let</i>
    it be at no cost, or at the least cost possible, will you? I am
    delighted in the meanwhile to hear of the quantity of 'mala herba';
    and hemlock does not come up from every seed you sow, though you call
    it by ever such bad names.
</p>
<p>
    Talking of poetry, I had a newspaper 'in help of social and political
    progress' sent to me yesterday from America&mdash;addressed to&mdash;just my
    name ... <i>poetess, London</i>! Think of the simplicity of those wild
    Americans in 'calculating' that 'people in general' here in England
    know what a poetess is!&mdash;Well&mdash;the post office authorities, after
    deep meditation, I do not doubt, on all probable varieties of the
    chimpanzee, and a glance to the Surrey Gardens on one side, and the
    Zoological department of Regent's Park on the other, thought of
    'Poet's Corner,' perhaps, and wrote at the top of the parcel, 'Enquire
    at Paternoster Row'! whereupon the Paternoster Row people wrote again,
    'Go to Mr. Moxon'&mdash;and I received my newspaper.
</p>
<p>
    And talking of poetesses, I had a note yesterday (again) which quite
    touched me ... from Mr. Hemans&mdash;Charles, the son of Felicia&mdash;written
    with so much feeling, that it was with difficulty I could say my
    perpetual 'no' to his wish about coming to see me. His mother's memory
    is surrounded to him, he says, 'with almost a divine lustre'&mdash;and 'as
    it cannot be to those who knew the writer alone and not the woman.' Do
    you not like to hear such things said? and is it not better than your
    tradition about Shelley's son? and is it not pleasant to know that
    that poor noble pure-hearted woman, the Vittoria Colonna of our
    country, should be so loved and comprehended by some ... by one at
    least ... of her own house? Not that, in naming Shelley, I meant for a
    moment to make a comparison&mdash;there is not equal ground for it.
    Vittoria Colonna does not walk near Dante&mdash;no. And if you promised
    never to tell Mrs. Jameson ... nor Miss Martineau ... I would confide
    to you perhaps my secret profession of faith&mdash;which is ... which is
    ... that let us say and do what we please and can ... there <i>is</i> a
    natural inferiority of mind in women&mdash;of the intellect ... not by any
    means, of the moral nature&mdash;and that the history of Art and of genius
    testifies to this fact openly. Oh&mdash;I would not say so to Mrs. Jameson
    for the world. I believe I was a coward to her altogether&mdash;for when
    she denounced carpet work as 'injurious to the mind,' because it led
    the workers into 'fatal habits of reverie,' I defended the carpet work
    as if I were striving <i>pro aris et focis</i>, (<i>I</i>, who am so innocent of
    all that knowledge!) and said not a word for the poor reveries which
    have frayed away so much of silken time for me ... and let her go
    away repeating again and again ... 'Oh, but <i>you</i> may do carpet work
    with impunity&mdash;yes! <i>because</i> you can be writing poems all the
    while.'!
</p>
<p>
    Think of people making poems and rugs at once. There's complex
    machinery for you!
</p>
<p>
    I told you that I had a sensation of cold blue steel from her
    eyes!&mdash;And yet I really liked and like and shall like her. She is very
    kind I believe&mdash;and it was my mistake&mdash;and I correct my impressions of
    her more and more to perfection, as <i>you</i> tell me who know more of her
    than I.
</p>
<p>
    Only I should not dare, ... <i>ever</i>, I think ... to tell her that I
    believe women ... all of us in a mass ... to have minds of quicker
    movement, but less power and depth ... and that we are under your
    feet, because we can't stand upon our own. Not that we should either
    be quite under your feet! so you are not to be too proud, if you
    please&mdash;and there is certainly some amount of wrong&mdash;: but it never
    will be righted in the manner and to the extent contemplated by
    certain of our own prophetesses ... nor ought to be, I hold in
    intimate persuasion. One woman indeed now alive ... and only <i>that</i>
    one down all the ages of the world&mdash;seems to me to justify for a
    moment an opposite opinion&mdash;that wonderful woman George Sand; who has
    something monstrous in combination with her genius, there is no
    denying at moments (for she has written one book, Leila, which I could
    not read, though I am not easily turned back,) but whom, in her good
    and evil together, I regard with infinitely more admiration than all
    other women of genius who are or have been. Such a colossal nature in
    every way,&mdash;with all that breadth and scope of faculty which women
    want&mdash;magnanimous, and loving the truth and loving the people&mdash;and
    with that 'hate of hate' too, which you extol&mdash;so eloquent, and yet
    earnest as if she were dumb&mdash;so full of a living sense of beauty, and
    of noble blind instincts towards an ideal purity&mdash;and so proving a
    right even in her wrong. By the way, what you say of the Vidocq museum
    reminds me of one of the chamber of masonic trial scenes in
    'Consuelo.' Could you like to see those knives?
</p>
<p>
    I began with the best intentions of writing six lines&mdash;and see what is
    written! And all because I kept my letter back ... from a <i>doubt about
    Saturday</i>&mdash;but it has worn away, and the appointment stands good ...
    for me: I have nothing to say against it.
</p>
<p>
    But belief in mesmerism is not the same thing as general unbelief&mdash;to
    do it justice&mdash;now is it? It may be super-belief as well. Not that
    there is not something ghastly and repelling to me in the thought of
    Dr. Elliotson's great bony fingers seeming to 'touch the stops' of a
    whole soul's harmonies&mdash;as in phreno-magnetism. And I should have
    liked far better than hearing and seeing <i>that</i>, to have heard <i>you</i>
    pour the 'cupful of Diderot's rinsings,' out,&mdash;and indeed I can fancy
    a little that you and how you could do it&mdash;and break the cup too
    afterwards!
</p>
<p>
    Another sheet&mdash;and for what?
</p>
<p>
    What is written already, if you read, you do so meritoriously&mdash;and
    it's an example of bad writing, if you want one in the poems. I am
    ashamed, you may see, of having written too much, (besides)&mdash;which is
    <i>much</i> worse&mdash;but one writes and writes: <i>I</i> do at least&mdash;for <i>you</i>
    are irreproachable. Ever yours my dear friend, as if I had not written

    While I write this,&mdash;3 o'clock you may be going out, I will hope, for
    the day is very fine, perhaps all the better for the wind: yet I got
    up this morning sure of bad weather. I shall not try to tell you how
    anxious I am for the result and to know it. You will of course feel
    fatigued at first&mdash;but persevering, as you mean to do, do you
    not?&mdash;persevering, the event must be happy.
</p>
<p>
    I thought, and still think, to write to you about George Sand, and
    the vexed question, a very Bermoothes of the 'Mental Claims of the
    Sexes Relatively Considered' (so was called the, ... I do believe, ...
    worst poem I ever read in my life), and Mrs. Hemans, and all and some
    of the points referred to in your letter&mdash;but 'by my fay, I cannot
    reason,' to-day: and, by a consequence, I feel the more&mdash;so I say how
    I want news of you ... which, when they arrive, I shall read
    'meritoriously'&mdash;do you think? My friend, what ought I to tell you on
    that head (or the reverse rather)&mdash;of your discourse? I should like to
    match you at a fancy-flight; if I could, give you nearly as pleasant
    an assurance that 'there's no merit in the case,' but the hot weather
    and lack of wit get the better of my good will&mdash;besides, I remember
    once to have admired a certain enticing simplicity in the avowal of
    the Treasurer of a Charitable Institution at a Dinner got up in its
    behalf&mdash;the Funds being at lowest, Debt at highest ... in fact, this
    Dinner was the last chance of the Charity, and this Treasurer's speech
    the main feature in the chance&mdash;and our friend, inspired by the
    emergency, went so far as to say, with a bland smile&mdash;'Do not let it
    be supposed that we&mdash;<i>despise</i> annual contributors,&mdash;we
    <i>rather</i>&mdash;solicit their assistance.' All which means, do not think
    that I take any 'merit' for making myself supremely happy, I rather

    Well&mdash;I have really been out; and am really alive after it&mdash;which is
    more surprising still&mdash;alive enough I mean, to write even <i>so</i>,
    to-night. But perhaps I say so with more emphasis, to console myself
    for failing in my great ambition of getting into the Park and of
    reaching Mr. Kenyon's door just to leave a card there vaingloriously,
    ... all which I did fail in, and was forced to turn back from the

    kindness made it worth while asking about I must not be over-wise and
    silent on my side.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Was it fair to tell me to write though, and be silent of
    the 'Duchess,' and when I was sure to be so delighted&mdash;and <i>you knew
    it</i>? <i>I</i> think not indeed. And, to make the obedience possible, I go
    on fast to say that I heard from Mr. Horne a few days since and that
    <i>he</i> said&mdash;'your envelope reminds me of'&mdash;<i>you</i>, he said ... and so,
    asked if you were in England still, and meant to write to you. To
    which I have answered that I believe you to be in England&mdash;thinking it
    strange about the envelope; which, as far as I remember, was one of
    those long ones, used, the more conveniently to enclose to him back
    again a MS. of his own I had offered with another of his, by his
    desire, to <i>Colburn's Magazine</i>, as the productions of a friend of
    mine, when he was in Germany and afraid of his proper fatal
    onymousness, yet in difficulty how to approach the magazines as a
    nameless writer (you will not mention this of course). And when he was
    in Germany, I remember, ... writing just as your first letter came ...
    that I mentioned it to him, and was a little frankly proud of it! but
    since, your name has not occurred once&mdash;not once, certainly!&mdash;and it
    is strange.... Only he <i>can't</i> have heard of your having been here,
    and it <i>must</i> have been a chance-remark&mdash;altogether! taking an
    imaginary emphasis from my evil conscience perhaps. Talking of evils,
    how wrong of you to make that book for me! and how ill I thanked you
    after all! Also, I couldn't help feeling more grateful still for the
    Duchess ... who is under ban: and for how long I wonder?

    You are all that is good and kind: I am happy and thankful the
    beginning (and worst of it) is over and so well. The Park and Mr.
    Kenyon's all in good time&mdash;and your sister was most prudent&mdash;and you
    mean to try again: God bless you, all to be said or done&mdash;but, as I
    say it, no vain word. No doubt it was a mere chance-thought, and <i>à
    propos de bottes</i> of Horne&mdash;neither he or any other <i>can</i> know or even
    fancy how it is. Indeed, though on other grounds I should be all so
    proud of being known for your friend by everybody, yet there's no
    denying the deep delight of playing the Eastern Jew's part here in
    this London&mdash;they go about, you know by travel-books, with the tokens
    of extreme destitution and misery, and steal by blind ways and
    by-paths to some blank dreary house, one obscure door in it&mdash;which
    being well shut behind them, they grope on through a dark corridor or
    so, and then, a blaze follows the lifting a curtain or the like, for
    they are in a palace-hall with fountains and light, and marble and
    gold, of which the envious are never to dream! And I, too, love to
    have few friends, and to live alone, and to see you from week to week.
    Do you not suppose I am grateful?
</p>
<p>
    And you do like the 'Duchess,' as much as you have got of it? that
    delights me, too&mdash;for every reason. But I fear I shall not be able to
    bring you the rest to-morrow&mdash;Thursday, my day&mdash;because I have been
    broken in upon more than one morning; nor, though much better in my
    head, can I do anything at night just now. All will come right
    eventually, I hope, and I shall transcribe the other things you are to
    judge.
</p>
<p>
    To-morrow then&mdash;only (and that is why I would write) do, do <i>know</i> me
    for what I am and treat me as I deserve in that <i>one</i> respect, and <i>go
    out</i>, without a moment's thought or care, if to-morrow should suit
    you&mdash;leave word to that effect and I shall be as glad as if I saw you
    or more&mdash;<i>reasoned</i> gladness, you know. Or you can write&mdash;though that
    is not necessary at all,&mdash;do think of all this!

    You understand that it was not a resolution passed in favour of
    formality, when I said what I did yesterday about not going out at the
    time you were coming&mdash;surely you do; whatever you might signify to a
    different effect. If it were necessary for me to go out every day, or
    most days even, it would be otherwise; but as it is, I may certainly
    keep the day you come, free from the fear of carriages, let the sun
    shine its best or worst, without doing despite to you or injury to
    me&mdash;and that's all I meant to insist upon indeed and indeed. You see,
    Jupiter Tonans was good enough to come to-day on purpose to deliver
    me&mdash;one evil for another! for I confess with shame and contrition,
    that I never wait to enquire whether it thunders to the left or the
    right, to be frightened most ingloriously. Isn't it a disgrace to
    anyone with a pretension to poetry? Dr. Chambers, a part of whose
    office it is, Papa says, 'to reconcile foolish women to their
    follies,' used to take the side of my vanity, and discourse at length
    on the passive obedience of some nervous systems to electrical
    influences; but perhaps my faint-heartedness is besides traceable to a
    half-reasonable terror of a great storm in Herefordshire, where great
    storms most do congregate, (such storms!) round the Malvern Hills,
    those mountains of England. We lived four miles from their roots,
    through all my childhood and early youth, in a Turkish house my father
    built himself, crowded with minarets and domes, and crowned with metal
    spires and crescents, to the provocation (as people used to observe)
    of every lightning of heaven. Once a storm of storms happened, and we
    all thought the house was struck&mdash;and a tree was so really, within two
    hundred yards of the windows while I looked out&mdash;the bark, rent from
    the top to the bottom ... torn into long ribbons by the dreadful fiery
    hands, and dashed out into the air, over the heads of other trees, or
    left twisted in their branches&mdash;torn into shreds in a moment, as a
    flower might be, by a child! Did you ever see a tree after it has been
    struck by lightning? The whole trunk of that tree was bare and
    peeled&mdash;and up that new whiteness of it, ran the finger-mark of the
    lightning in a bright beautiful rose-colour (none of your roses
    brighter or more beautiful!) the fever-sign of the certain
    death&mdash;though the branches themselves were for the most part
    untouched, and spread from the peeled trunk in their full summer
    foliage; and birds singing in them three hours afterwards! And, in
    that same storm, two young women belonging to a festive party were
    killed on the Malvern Hills&mdash;each sealed to death in a moment with a
    sign on the chest which a common seal would cover&mdash;only the sign on
    them was not rose-coloured as on our tree, but black as charred wood.
    So I get 'possessed' sometimes with the effects of these impressions,
    and so does one, at least, of my sisters, in a lower degree&mdash;and
    oh!&mdash;how amusing and instructive all this is to you! When my father
    came into the room to-day and found me hiding my eyes from the
    lightning, he was quite angry and called 'it disgraceful to anybody
    who had ever learnt the alphabet'&mdash;to which I answered humbly that 'I
    knew it was'&mdash;but if I had been impertinent, I <i>might</i> have added that
    wisdom does not come by the alphabet but in spite of it? Don't you
    think so in a measure? <i>non obstantibus</i> Bradbury and Evans? There's a
    profane question&mdash;and ungrateful too ... after the Duchess&mdash;I except
    the Duchess and her peers&mdash;and be sure she will be the world's Duchess
    and received as one of your most striking poems. Full of various power
    the poem is.... I cannot say how deeply it has impressed me&mdash;but
    though I want the conclusion, I don't <i>wish</i> for it; and in this, am
    reasonable for once! You will not write and make yourself ill&mdash;will
    you? or read 'Sybil' at unlawful hours even? Are you better at all?
    What a letter! and how very foolishly to-day

<p>
    Very well&mdash;I shall say no more on the subject&mdash;though it was not any
    piece of formality on your part that I deprecated; nor even your
    over-kindness exactly&mdash;I rather wanted you to be really, wisely kind,
    and do me a greater favour then the next great one in degree; but you
    must understand this much in me, how you can lay me under deepest
    obligation. I daresay you think you have some, perhaps many, to whom
    your well-being is of deeper interest than to me. Well, if that be
    so, do for their sakes make every effort with the remotest chance of
    proving serviceable to you; nor <i>set yourself against</i> any little
    irksomeness these carriage-drives may bring with them just at the
    beginning; and you may say, if you like, 'how I shall delight those
    friends, if I can make this newest one grateful'&mdash;and, as from the
    known quantity one reasons out the unknown, this newest friend will be
    one glow of gratitude, he knows that, if you can warm your finger-tips
    and so do yourself that much real good, by setting light to a dozen
    'Duchesses': why ought I not to say this when it is so true? Besides,
    people profess as much to their merest friends&mdash;for I have been
    looking through a poem-book just now, and was told, under the head of
    Album-verses alone, that for A. the writer would die, and for B. die
    too but a crueller death, and for C. too, and D. and so on. I wonder
    whether they have since wanted to borrow money of him on the strength
    of his professions. But you must remember we are in July; the 13th it
    is, and summer will go and cold weather stay ('<i>come</i>' forsooth!)&mdash;and
    now is the time of times. Still I feared the rain would hinder you on
    Friday&mdash;but the thunder did not frighten me&mdash;for you: your father must
    pardon me for holding most firmly with Dr. Chambers&mdash;his theory is
    quite borne out by my own experience, for I have seen a man it were
    foolish to call a coward, a great fellow too, all but die away in a
    thunderstorm, though he had quite science enough to explain why there
    was no immediate danger at all&mdash;whereupon his younger brother
    suggested that he should just go out and treat us to a repetition of
    Franklin's experiment with the cloud and the kite&mdash;a well-timed
    proposition which sent the Explainer down with a white face into the
    cellar. What a grand sight your tree was&mdash;<i>is</i>, for I see it. My
    father has a print of a tree so struck&mdash;torn to ribbons, as you
    describe&mdash;but the rose-mark is striking and new to me. We had a good
    storm on our last voyage, but I went to bed at the end, as I
    thought&mdash;and only found there had been lightning next day by the bare
    poles under which we were riding: but the finest mountain fit of the
    kind I ever saw has an unfortunately ludicrous association. It was at
    Possagno, among the Euganean Hills, and I was at a poor house in the
    town&mdash;an old woman was before a little picture of the Virgin, and at
    every fresh clap she lighted, with the oddest sputtering muttering
    mouthful of prayer imaginable, an inch of guttery candle, which, the
    instant the last echo had rolled away, she as constantly blew out
    again for saving's sake&mdash;having, of course, to <i>light the smoke</i> of
    it, about an instant after that: the expenditure in wax at which the
    elements might be propitiated, you see, was a matter for curious
    calculation. I suppose I ought to have bought the whole taper for some
    four or five centesimi (100 of which make 8d. English) and so kept the
    countryside safe for about a century of bad weather. Leigh Hunt tells
    you a story he had from Byron, of kindred philosophy in a Jew who was
    surprised by a thunderstorm while he was dining on bacon&mdash;he tried to
    eat between-whiles, but the flashes were as pertinacious as he, so at
    last he pushed his plate away, just remarking with a compassionate
    shrug, 'all this fuss about a piece of pork!' By the way, what a
    characteristic of an Italian <i>late</i> evening is Summer-lightning&mdash;it
    hangs in broad slow sheets, dropping from cloud to cloud, so long in
    dropping and dying off. The 'bora,' which you only get at Trieste,
    brings wonderful lightning&mdash;you are in glorious June-weather, fancy,
    of an evening, under green shock-headed acacias, so thick and green,
    with the cicalas stunning you above, and all about you men, women,
    rich and poor, sitting standing and coming and going&mdash;and through all
    the laughter and screaming and singing, the loud clink of the spoons
    against the glasses, the way of calling for fresh 'sorbetti'&mdash;for all
    the world is at open-coffee-house at such an hour&mdash;when suddenly there
    is a stop in the sunshine, a blackness drops down, then a great white
    column of dust drives straight on like a wedge, and you see the acacia
    heads snap off, now one, then another&mdash;and all the people scream 'la
    bora, la bora!' and you are caught up in their whirl and landed in
    some interior, the man with the guitar on one side of you, and the boy
    with a cageful of little brown owls for sale, on the other&mdash;meanwhile,
    the thunder claps, claps, with such a persistence, and the rain, for a
    finale, falls in a mass, as if you had knocked out the whole bottom of
    a huge tank at once&mdash;then there is a second stop&mdash;out comes the
    sun&mdash;somebody clinks at his glass, all the world bursts out laughing,
    and prepares to pour out again,&mdash;but <i>you</i>, the stranger, <i>do</i> make
    the best of your way out, with no preparation at all; whereupon you
    infallibly put your foot (and half your leg) into a river, really
    that, of rainwater&mdash;that's a <i>Bora</i> (and that comment of yours, a
    justifiable pun!) Such things you get in Italy, but better, better,
    the best of all things you do not (<i>I</i> do not) get those. And I shall
    see you on Wednesday, please remember, and bring you the rest of the
    poem&mdash;that you should like it, gratifies me more than I will try to
    say, but then, do not you be tempted by that pleasure of pleasing
    which I think is your besetting sin&mdash;may it not be?&mdash;and so cut me off
    from the other pleasure of being profited. As I told you, I like so
    much to fancy that you see, and will see, what I do as <i>I</i> see it,
    while it is doing, as nobody else in the world should, certainly, even
    if they thought it worth while to want&mdash;but when I try and build a
    great building I shall want you to come with me and judge it and
    counsel me before the scaffolding is taken down, and while you have to
    make your way over hods and mortar and heaps of lime, and trembling
    tubs of size, and those thin broad whitewashing brushes I always had a
    desire to take up and bespatter with. And now goodbye&mdash;I am to see you
    on Wednesday I trust&mdash;and to hear you say you are better, still
    better, much better? God grant that, and all else good for you, dear
    friend, and so for R.B.

    I suppose nobody is ever expected to acknowledge his or her 'besetting
    sin'&mdash;it would be unnatural&mdash;and therefore you will not be surprised
    to hear me deny the one imputed to me for mine. I deny it quite and
    directly. And if my denial goes for nothing, which is but reasonable,
    I might call in a great cloud of witnesses, ... a thundercloud, ...
    (talking of storms!) and even seek no further than this table for a
    first witness; this letter, I had yesterday, which calls me ... let me
    see how many hard names ... 'unbending,' ... 'disdainful,' ... 'cold
    hearted,' ... 'arrogant,' ... yes, 'arrogant, as women always are when
    men grow humble' ... there's a charge against all possible and
    probable petticoats beyond mine and through it! Not that either they
    or mine deserve the charge&mdash;we do not; to the lowest hem of us! for I
    don't pass to the other extreme, mind, and adopt besetting sins 'over
    the way' and in antithesis. It's an undeserved charge, and unprovoked!
    and in fact, the very flower of self-love self-tormented into ill
    temper; and shall remain unanswered, for <i>me</i>, ... and <i>should</i>, ...
    even if I could write mortal epigrams, as your Lamia speaks them. Only
    it serves to help my assertion that people in general who know
    something of me, my dear friend, are not inclined to agree with you in
    particular, about my having an 'over-pleasure in pleasing,' for a
    besetting sin. If you had spoken of my sister Henrietta indeed, you
    would have been right&mdash;<i>so</i> right! but for <i>me</i>, alas, my sins are not
    half as amiable, nor given to lean to virtue's side with half such a
    grace. And then I have a pretension to speak the truth like a Roman,
    even in matters of literature, where Mr. Kenyon says falseness is a
    fashion&mdash;and really and honestly I should not be afraid ... I should
    have no reason to be afraid, ... if all the notes and letters written
    by my hand for years and years about presentation copies of poems and
    other sorts of books were brought together and 'conferred,' as they
    say of manuscripts, before my face&mdash;I should not shrink and be
    ashamed. Not that I always tell the truth as I see it&mdash;<i>but</i> I <i>never
    do</i> speak falsely with intention and consciousness&mdash;never&mdash;and I do
    not find that people of letters are sooner offended than others are,
    by the truth told in gentleness;&mdash;I do not remember to have offended
    anyone in this relation, and by these means. Well!&mdash;but <i>from me to
    you</i>; it is all different, you know&mdash;you must know how different it
    is. I can tell you truly what I think of this thing and of that thing
    in your 'Duchess'&mdash;but I must of a necessity hesitate and fall into
    misgiving of the adequacy of my truth, so called. To judge at all of a
    work of yours, I must <i>look up to it</i>, and <i>far up</i>&mdash;because whatever
    faculty <i>I</i> have is included in your faculty, and with a great rim all
    round it besides! And thus, it is not at all from an over-pleasure in
    pleasing <i>you</i>, not at all from an inclination to depreciate myself,
    that I speak and feel as I do and must on some occasions; it is simply
    the consequence of a true comprehension of you and of me&mdash;and apart
    from it, I should not be abler, I think, but less able, to assist you
    in anything. I do wish you would consider all this reasonably, and
    understand it as a third person would in a moment, and consent not to
    spoil the real pleasure I have and am about to have in your poetry, by
    nailing me up into a false position with your gold-headed nails of
    chivalry, which won't hold to the wall through this summer. Now you
    will not answer this?&mdash;you will only understand it and me&mdash;and that I
    am not servile but sincere, but earnest, but meaning what I say&mdash;and
    when I say I am afraid, you will believe that I am afraid; and when I
    say I have misgivings, you will believe that I have misgivings&mdash;you
    will <i>trust</i> me so far, and give me liberty to breathe and feel
    naturally ... according to my own nature. Probably, or certainly
    rather, I have one advantage over you, ... one, of which women are not
    fond of boasting&mdash;that of <i>being older by years</i>&mdash;for the 'Essay on
    Mind,' which was the first poem published by me (and rather more
    printed than published after all), the work of my earliest youth, half
    childhood, half womanhood, was published in 1826 I see. And if I told
    Mr. Kenyon not to let you see that book, it was not for the date, but
    because Coleridge's daughter was right in calling it a mere 'girl's
    exercise'; because it is just <i>that</i> and no more, ... no expression
    whatever of my nature as it ever was, ... pedantic, and in some things
    pert, ... and such as altogether, and to do myself justice (which I
    would fain do of course), I was not in my whole life. Bad books are
    never like their writers, you know&mdash;and those under-age books are
    generally bad. Also I have found it hard work to <i>get into
    expression</i>, though I began rhyming from my very infancy, much as you
    did (and this, with no sympathy near to me&mdash;I have had to do without
    sympathy in the full sense&mdash;), and even in my 'Seraphim' days, my
    tongue clove to the roof of my mouth,&mdash;from leading so conventual
    recluse a life, perhaps&mdash;and all my better poems were written last
    year, the very best thing to come, if there should be any life or
    courage to come; I scarcely know. Sometimes&mdash;it is the real truth&mdash;I
    have haste to be done with it all. It is the real truth; however to
    say so may be an ungrateful return for your kind and generous words,
    ... which I <i>do</i> feel gratefully, let me otherwise feel as I will, ...
    or must. But then you know you are liable to such prodigious mistakes
    about besetting sins and even besetting virtues&mdash;to such a set of
    small delusions, that are sure to break one by one, like other
    bubbles, as you draw in your breath, ... as I see by the law of my own
    star, my own particular star, the star I was born under, the star
    <i>Wormwood</i>, ... on the opposite side of the heavens from the
    constellations of 'the Lyre and the Crown.' In the meantime, it is
    difficult to thank you, or <i>not</i> to thank you, for all your
    kindnesses&mdash;<span title="algos de sigan">&alpha;&lambda;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; &delta;&epsilon; &sigma;&iota;&gamma;&alpha;&nu;</span>. Only Mrs. Jameson told me of Lady
    Byron's saying 'that she knows she is burnt every day in effigy by
    half the world, but that the effigy is so unlike herself as to be
    inoffensive to her,' and just so, or rather just in the converse of
    <i>so</i>, is it with me and your kindnesses. They are meant for quite
    another than I, and are too far to be so near. The comfort is ... in
    seeing you throw all those ducats out of the window, (and how many
    ducats go in a figure to a 'dozen Duchesses,' it is profane to
    calculate) the comfort is that you will not be the poorer for it in
    the end; since the people beneath, are honest enough to push them back
    under the door. Rather a bleak comfort and occupation though!&mdash;and you
    may find better work for your friends, who are (some of them) weary
    even unto death of the uses of this life. And now, you who are
    generous, <i>be</i> generous, and take no notice of all this. I speak of
    myself, not of you so there is nothing for you to contradict or
    discuss&mdash;and if there were, you would be really kind and give me my
    way in it. Also you may take courage; for I promise not to vex you by
    thanking you against <i>your</i> will,&mdash;more than may be helped.

    Some of this letter was written before yesterday and in reply of
    course to yours&mdash;so it is to pass for two letters, being long enough
    for just six. Yesterday you must have wondered at me for being in such
    a maze altogether about the poems&mdash;and so now I rise to explain that
    it was assuredly the wine song and no other which I read of yours in
    <i>Hood's</i>. And then, what did I say of the Dante and Beatrice? Because
    what I referred to was the exquisite page or two or three on that
    subject in the 'Pentameron.' I do not remember anything else of
    Landor's with the same bearing&mdash;do you? As to Montaigne, with the
    threads of my thoughts smoothly disentangled, I can see nothing
    coloured by him ... nothing. Do bring all the <i>Hood</i> poems of your
    own&mdash;inclusive of the 'Tokay,' because I read it in such haste as to
    whirl up all the dust you saw, from the wheels of my chariot. The
    'Duchess' is past speaking of here&mdash;but you will see how I am
    delighted. And we must make speed&mdash;only taking care of your head&mdash;for
    I heard to-day that Papa and my aunt are discussing the question of
    sending me off either to Alexandria or Malta for the winter. Oh&mdash;it
    is quite a passing talk and thought, I dare say! and it would not <i>be</i>
    in any case, until September or October; though in every case, I
    suppose, <i>I</i> should not be much consulted ... and all cases and places
    would seem better to me (if I were) than Madeira which the physicians
    used to threaten me with long ago. So take care of your headache and
    let us have the 'Bells' rung out clear before the summer ends ... and
    pray don't say again anything about clear consciences or unclear ones,
    in granting me the privilege of reading your manuscripts&mdash;which is all
    clear privilege to me, with pride and gladness waiting on it. May God
    bless you always my dear friend!

    I shall just say, at the beginning of a note as at the end, I am yours
    <i>ever</i>, and not till summer ends and my nails fall out, and my breath
    breaks bubbles,&mdash;ought you to write thus having restricted me as you
    once did, and do still? You tie me like a Shrove-Tuesday fowl to a
    stake and then pick the thickest cudgel out of your lot, and at my
    head it goes&mdash;I wonder whether you remembered having predicted exactly
    the same horror once before. 'I was to see you&mdash;and you were to
    understand'&mdash;<i>Do</i> you? do you understand&mdash;my own friend&mdash;with that
    superiority in years, too! For I confess to that&mdash;you need not throw
    that in my teeth ... as soon as I read your 'Essay on Mind'&mdash;(which of
    course I managed to do about 12 hours after Mr. K's positive refusal
    to keep his promise, and give me the book) from preface to the 'Vision
    of Fame' at the end, and reflected on my own doings about that time,
    1826&mdash;I did indeed see, and wonder at, your advance over me in
    years&mdash;what then? I have got nearer you considerably&mdash;(if only
    nearer)&mdash;since then&mdash;and prove it by the remarks I make at favourable
    times&mdash;such as this, for instance, which occurs in a poem you are to
    see&mdash;written some time ago&mdash;which advises nobody who thinks nobly of
    the Soul, to give, if he or she can help, such a good argument to the
    materialist as the owning that any great choice of that Soul, which it
    is born to make and which&mdash;(in its determining, as it must, the whole
    future course and impulses of that soul)&mdash;which must endure for ever,
    even though the object that induced the choice should
    disappear&mdash;owning, I say, that such a choice may be scientifically
    determined and produced, at any operator's pleasure, by a definite
    number of ingredients, so much youth, so much beauty, so much talent
    &amp;c. &amp;c., with the same certainty and precision that another kind of
    operator will construct you an artificial volcano with so much steel
    filings and flower of sulphur and what not. There is more in the soul
    than rises to the surface and meets the eye; whatever does <i>that</i>, is
    for this world's immediate uses; and were this world <i>all, all</i> in us
    would be producible and available for use, as it <i>is</i> with the body
    now&mdash;but with the soul, what is to be developed <i>afterward</i> is the
    main thing, and instinctively asserts its rights&mdash;so that when you
    hate (or love) you shall not be so able to explain 'why' ('You' is the
    ordinary creature enough of my poem&mdash;<i>he</i> might not be so able.)
</p>
<p>
    There, I will write no more. You will never drop <i>me</i> off the golden
    hooks, I dare believe&mdash;and the rest is with God&mdash;whose finger I see
    every minute of my life. Alexandria! Well, and may I not as easily ask
    leave to come 'to-morrow at the Muezzin' as next Wednesday at three?
</p>
<p>
    God bless you&mdash;do not be otherwise than kind to this letter which it
    costs me pains, great pains to avoid writing better, as
    truthfuller&mdash;this you get is not the first begun. Come, you shall not
    have the heart to blame me; for, see, I will send all my sins of
    commission with <i>Hood</i>,&mdash;blame <i>them</i>, tell me about them, and
    meantime let me be, dear friend, yours,

<p>
    But I never <i>did</i> strike you or touch you&mdash;and you are not in earnest
    in the complaint you make&mdash;and this is really all I am going to say
    to-day. What I said before was wrung from me by words on your part,
    while you know far too well how to speak so as to make them go
    deepest, and which sometimes it becomes impossible, or over-hard to
    bear without deprecation:&mdash;as when, for instance, you talk of being
    'grateful' to <i>me</i>!!&mdash;Well! I will try that there shall be no more of
    it&mdash;no more provocation of generosities&mdash;and so, (this once) as you
    express it, I 'will not have the heart to blame' you&mdash;except for
    reading my books against my will, which was very wrong indeed. Mr.
    Kenyon asked me, I remember, (he had a mania of sending my copybook
    literature round the world to this person and that person, and I was
    roused at last into binding him by a vow to do so no more) I remember
    he asked me ... 'Is Mr. Browning to be excepted?'; to which I answered
    that nobody was to be excepted&mdash;and thus he was quite right in
    resisting to the death ... or to dinner-time ... just as you were
    quite wrong after dinner. Now, could a woman have been more curious?
    Could the very author of the book have done worse? But I leave my sins
    and yours gladly, to get into the <i>Hood</i> poems which have delighted me
    so&mdash;and first to the St. Praxed's which is of course the finest and
    most powerful ... and indeed full of the power of life ... and of
    death. It has impressed me very much. Then the 'Angel and Child,' with
    all its beauty and significance!&mdash;and the 'Garden Fancies' ... some of
    the stanzas about the name of the flower, with such exquisite music in
    them, and grace of every kind&mdash;and with that beautiful and musical use
    of the word 'meandering,' which I never remember having seen used in
    relation to <i>sound</i> before. It does to mate with your '<i>simmering</i>
    quiet' in Sordello, which brings the summer air into the room as sure
    as you read it. Then I like your burial of the pedant so much!&mdash;you
    have quite the damp smell of funguses and the sense of creeping things
    through and through it. And the 'Laboratory' is hideous as you meant
    to make it:&mdash;only I object a little to your tendency ... which is
    almost a habit, and is very observable in this poem I think, ... of
    making lines difficult for the reader to read ... see the opening
    lines of this poem. Not that music is required everywhere, nor in
    <i>them</i> certainly, but that the uncertainty of rhythm throws the
    reader's mind off the <i>rail</i> ... and interrupts his progress with you
    and your influence with him. Where we have not direct pleasure from
    rhythm, and where no peculiar impression is to be produced by the
    changes in it, we should be encouraged by the poet to <i>forget it
    altogether</i>; should we not? I am quite wrong perhaps&mdash;but you see how
    I do not conceal my wrongnesses where they mix themselves up with my
    sincere impressions. And how could it be that no one within my hearing
    ever spoke of these poems? Because it is true that I never saw one of
    them&mdash;never!&mdash;except the 'Tokay,' which is inferior to all; and that I
    was quite unaware of your having printed so much with Hood&mdash;or at all,
    except this 'Tokay,' and this 'Duchess'! The world is very deaf and
    dumb, I think&mdash;but in the end, we need not be afraid of its not
    learning its lesson.
</p>
<p>
    Could you come&mdash;for I am going out in the carriage, and will not stay
    to write of your poems even, any more to-day&mdash;could you come on
    Thursday or Friday (the day left to your choice) instead of on
    Wednesday? If I could help it I would not say so&mdash;it is not a caprice.
    And I leave it to you, whether Thursday or Friday. And Alexandria
    seems discredited just now for Malta&mdash;and 'anything but Madeira,' I go
    on saying to myself. These <i>Hood</i> poems are all to be in the next
    'Bells' of course&mdash;of necessity?

    Are you any better to-day? and will you say just the truth of it? and
    not attempt to do any of the writing which does harm&mdash;nor of the
    reading even, which may do harm&mdash;and something does harm to you, you
    see&mdash;and you told me not long ago that you knew how to avoid the harm
    ... now, did you not? and what could it have been last week which you
    did not avoid, and which made you so unwell? Beseech you not to think
    that I am going to aid and abet in this wronging of yourself, for I
    will not indeed&mdash;and I am only sorry to have given you my querulous
    queries yesterday ... and to have omitted to say in relation to them,
    too, how they were to be accepted in any case as just passing thoughts
    of mine for <i>your</i> passing thoughts, ... some right, it may be ...
    some wrong, it must be ... and none, insisted on even by the thinker!
    just impressions, and by no means pretending to be judgments&mdash;now
    <i>will</i> you understand? Also, I intended (as a proof of my fallacy) to
    strike out one or two of my doubts before I gave the paper to you&mdash;so
    <i>whichever strikes you as the most foolish of them, of course must be
    what I meant to strike out</i>&mdash;(there's ingenuity for you!). The poem
    did, for the rest, as will be suggested to you, give me the very
    greatest pleasure, and astonish me in two ways ... by the
    versification, mechanically considered; and by the successful
    evolution of pure beauty from all that roughness and rudeness of the
    sin of the boar-pinner&mdash;successfully evolved, without softening one
    hoarse accent of his voice. But there is to be a pause now&mdash;you will
    not write any more&mdash;no, nor come here on Wednesday, if coming into the
    roar of this London should make the pain worse, as I cannot help
    thinking it must&mdash;and you were not well yesterday morning, you
    admitted. You <i>will</i> take care? And if there should be a wisdom in
    going away...!
</p>
<p>
    Was it very wrong of me, doing what I told you of yesterday? Very
    imprudent, I am afraid&mdash;but I never knew how to be prudent&mdash;and then,
    there is not a sharing of responsibility in any sort of imaginable
    measure; but a mere going away of so many thoughts, apart from the
    thinker, or of words, apart from the speaker, ... just as I might give
    away a pocket-handkerchief to be newly marked and mine no longer. I
    did not do&mdash;and would not have done, ... one of those papers singly.
    It would have been unbecoming of me in every way. It was simply a
    writing of notes ... of slips of paper ... now on one subject, and now
    on another ... which were thrown into the great cauldron and boiled up
    with other matter, and re-translated from my idiom where there seemed
    a need for it. And I am not much afraid of being ever guessed
    at&mdash;except by those Oedipuses who astounded me once for a moment and
    were after all, I hope, baffled by the Sphinx&mdash;or ever betrayed;
    because besides the black Stygian oaths and indubitable honour of the
    editor, he has some interest, even as I have the greatest, in being
    silent and secret. And nothing <i>is mine</i> ... if something is <i>of me</i>
    ... or <i>from</i> me, rather. Yet it was wrong and foolish, I see
    plainly&mdash;wrong in all but the motives. How dreadful to write against
    time, and with a side-ways running conscience! And then the literature
    of the day was wider than his knowledge, all round! And the
    booksellers were barking distraction on every side!&mdash;I had some of the
    mottos to find too! But the paper relating to you I never was
    consulted about&mdash;or in <i>one particular way</i> it would have been
    better,&mdash;as easily it might have been. May God bless you, my dear
    friend,

[Post-mark, July 25, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    You would let me <i>now</i>, I dare say, call myself grateful to you&mdash;yet
    such is my jealousy in these matters&mdash;so do I hate the material when
    it puts down, (or tries) the immaterial in the offices of friendship;
    that I could almost tell you I was <i>not</i> grateful, and try if that way
    I could make you see the substantiality of those other favours you
    refuse to recognise, and reality of the other gratitude you will not
    admit. But truth is truth, and you are all generosity, and will draw
    none but the fair inference, so I thank you as well as I can for this
    <i>also</i>&mdash;this last kindness. And you know its value, too&mdash;how if there
    were another <i>you</i> in the world, who had done all you have done and
    whom I merely admired for that; if such an one had sent me such a
    criticism, so exactly what I want and can use and turn to good; you
    know how I would have told you, my <i>you</i> I saw yesterday, all about
    it, and been sure of your sympathy and gladness:&mdash;but the two in one!
</p>
<p>
    For the criticism itself, it is all true, except the over-eating&mdash;all
    the suggestions are to be adopted, the improvements accepted. I so
    thoroughly understand your spirit in this, that, just in this
    beginning, I should really like to have found some point in which I
    could coöperate with your intention, and help my work by disputing the
    effect of any alteration proposed, if it ought to be disputed&mdash;<i>that</i>
    would answer your purpose exactly as well as agreeing with you,&mdash;so
    that the benefit to me were apparent; but this time I cannot dispute
    one point. All is for best.
</p>
<p>
    So much for this 'Duchess'&mdash;which I shall ever rejoice in&mdash;wherever
    was a bud, even, in that strip of May-bloom, a live musical bee hangs
    now. I shall let it lie (my poem), till just before I print it; and
    then go over it, alter at the places, and do something for the places
    where I (really) wrote anyhow, almost, to get done. It is an odd fact,
    yet characteristic of my accomplishings one and all in this kind, that
    of <i>the poem</i>, the real conception of an evening (two years ago,
    fully)&mdash;of <i>that</i>, not a line is written,&mdash;though perhaps after all,
    what I am going to call the accessories in the story are real though
    indirect reflexes of the original idea, and so supersede properly
    enough the necessity of its personal appearance, so to speak. But, as
    I conceived the poem, it consisted entirely of the Gipsy's description
    of the life the Lady was to lead with her future Gipsy lover&mdash;a <i>real</i>
    life, not an unreal one like that with the Duke. And as I meant to
    write it, all their wild adventures would have come out and the
    insignificance of the former vegetation have been deducible only&mdash;as
    the main subject has become now; of course it comes to the same thing,
    for one would never show half by half like a cut orange.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Will you write to me? caring, though, so much for my best interests as
    not to write if you can work for yourself, or save yourself fatigue. I
    <i>think</i> before writing&mdash;or just after writing&mdash;such a sentence&mdash;but
    reflection only justifies my first feeling; I <i>would</i> rather go
    without your letters, without seeing you at all, if that advantaged
    you&mdash;my dear, first and last friend; my friend! And now&mdash;surely I
    might dare say you may if you please get well through God's
    goodness&mdash;with persevering patience, surely&mdash;and this next winter
    abroad&mdash;which you must get ready for now, every sunny day, will you
    not? If I venture to weary you again with all this, is there not the
    cause of causes, and did not the prophet write that 'there was a tide
    in the affairs of men, which taken at the E.B.B.' led on to the
    fortune of
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your R.B.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, let me tell you in the bitterness of my heart, that it was only 4
    o'clock&mdash;that clock I enquired about&mdash;and that, ... no, I shall never
    say with any grace what I want to say ... and now dare not ... that
    you all but owe me an extra quarter of an hour next time: as in the
    East you give a beggar something for a few days running&mdash;then you miss
    him; and next day he looks indignant when the regular dole falls and
    murmurs&mdash;'And, for yesterday?'&mdash;Do I stay too long, I <i>want</i> to
    know,&mdash;too long for the voice and head and all but the spirit that may
    not so soon tire,&mdash;knowing the good it does. If you would but tell me.

    You say too much indeed in this letter which has crossed mine&mdash;and
    particularly as there is not a word in it of what I most wanted to
    know and want to know ... <i>how you are</i>&mdash;for you must observe, if you
    please, that the very paper you pour such kindness on, was written
    after your own example and pattern, when, in the matter of my
    'Prometheus' (such different wearying matter!), you took trouble for
    me and did me good. Judge from this, if even in inferior things, there
    can be gratitude from you to me!&mdash;or rather, do not judge&mdash;but listen
    when I say that I am delighted to have met your wishes in writing as I
    wrote; only that you are surely wrong in refusing to see a single
    wrongness in all that heap of weedy thoughts, and that when you look
    again, you must come to the admission of it. One of the thistles is
    the suggestion about the line
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Was it singing, was it saying,
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">
    which you wrote so, and which I proposed to amend by an intermediate
    'or.' Thinking of it at a distance, it grows clear to me that you were
    right, and that there should be and must be no 'or' to disturb the
    listening pause. Now <i>should</i> there? And there was something else,
    which I forget at this moment&mdash;and something more than the something
    else. Your account of the production of the poem interests me very
    much&mdash;and proves just what I wanted to make out from your statements
    the other day, and they refused, I thought, to let me, ... that you
    are more faithful to your first <i>Idea</i> than to your first <i>plan</i>. Is
    it so? or not? 'Orange' is orange&mdash;but <i>which half</i> of the orange is
    not predestinated from all eternity&mdash;: is it <i>so</i>?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I wrote so much yesterday and then went out, not knowing
    very well how to speak or how to be silent (is it better to-day?) of
    some expressions of yours ... and of your interest in me&mdash;which are
    deeply affecting to my feelings&mdash;whatever else remains to be said of
    them. And you know that you make great mistakes, ... of fennel for
    hemlock, of four o'clocks for five o'clocks, and of other things of
    more consequence, one for another; and may not be quite right besides
    as to my getting well '<i>if I please</i>!' ... which reminds me a little
    of what Papa says sometimes when he comes into this room unexpectedly
    and convicts me of having dry toast for dinner, and declares angrily
    that obstinacy and dry toast have brought me to my present condition,
    and that if I <i>pleased</i> to have porter and beefsteaks instead, I
    should be as well as ever I was, in a month!... But where is the need
    of talking of it? What I wished to say was this&mdash;that if I get better
    or worse ... as long as I live and to the last moment of life, I shall
    remember with an emotion which cannot change its character, all the
    generous interest and feeling you have spent on me&mdash;<i>wasted</i> on me I
    was going to write&mdash;but I would not provoke any answering&mdash;and in one
    obvious sense, it need not be so. I never shall forget these things,
    my dearest friend; nor remember them more coldly. God's goodness!&mdash;I
    believe in it, as in His sunshine here&mdash;which makes my head ache a
    little, while it comes in at the window, and makes most other people
    gayer&mdash;it does <i>me</i> good too in a different way. And so, may God bless
    you! and me in this ... just this, ... that I may never have the
    sense, ... intolerable in the remotest apprehension of it ... of
    being, in any way, directly or indirectly, the means of ruffling your
    smooth path by so much as one of my flint-stones!&mdash;In the meantime you
    do not tire me indeed even when you go later for sooner ... and I do
    not tire myself even when I write longer and duller letters to you (if
    the last is possible) than the one I am ending now ... as the most

<p>
    Let me write one word ... not to have it off my mind ... because it is
    by no means heavily <i>on</i> it; but lest I should forget to write it at
    all by not writing it at once. What could you mean, ... I have been
    thinking since you went away ... by applying such a grave expression
    as having a thing 'off your mind' to that foolish subject of the
    stupid book (mine), and by making it worth your while to account
    logically for your wish about my not mentioning it to Mr. Kenyon? You
    could not fancy for one moment that I was vexed in the matter of the
    book? or in the other matter of your wish? Now just hear me. I
    explained to you that I had been silent to Mr. Kenyon, first because
    the fact was so; and next and a little, because I wanted to show how I
    anticipated your wish by a wish of my own ... though from a different
    motive. <i>Your</i> motive I really did take to be (never suspecting my
    dear kind cousin of treason) to be a natural reluctancy of being
    convicted (forgive me!) of such an arch-womanly curiosity. For my own
    motive ... motives ... they are more than one ... you must trust me;
    and refrain as far as you can from accusing me of an over-love of
    Eleusinian mysteries when I ask you to say just as little about your
    visits here and of me as you find possible ... <i>even to Mr. Kenyon</i>
    ... as <i>to every other person whatever</i>. As you know ... and yet more
    than you know ... I am in a peculiar position&mdash;and it does not follow
    that you should be ashamed of my friendship or that I should not be
    proud of yours, if we avoid making it a subject of conversation in
    high places, or low places. There! <i>that</i> is my request to you&mdash;or
    commentary on what you put 'off your mind' yesterday&mdash;probably quite
    unnecessary as either request or commentary; yet said on the chance of
    its not being so, because you seemed to mistake my remark about Mr.
    Kenyon.
</p>
<p>
    And your head, how is it? And do consider if it would not be wise and
    right on that account of your health, to go with Mr. Chorley? You can
    neither work nor enjoy while you are subject to attacks of the
    kind&mdash;and besides, and without reference to your present suffering and
    inconvenience, you <i>ought not</i> to let them master you and gather
    strength from time and habit; I am sure you ought not. Worse last week
    than ever, you see!&mdash;and no prospect, perhaps, of bringing out your
    "Bells" this autumn, without paying a cost too heavy!&mdash;Therefore ...
    the <i>therefore</i> is quite plain and obvious!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    <i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Just as it is how anxious Flush and I are, to be delivered
    from you; by these sixteen heads of the discourse of one of us,
    written before your letter came. Ah, but I am serious&mdash;and you will
    consider&mdash;will you not? what is best to be done? and do it. You could
    write to me, you know, from the end of the world; if you could take
    the thought of me so far.
</p>
<p>
    And <i>for</i> me, no, and yet yes,&mdash;I <i>will</i> say this much; that I am not
    inclined to do you injustice, but justice, when you come here&mdash;the
    justice of wondering to myself how you can possibly, possibly, care to
    come. Which is true enough to be <i>unanswerable</i>, if you please&mdash;or I
    should not say it. '<i>As I began, so I shall end</i>&mdash;' Did you, as I hope
    you did, thank your sister for Flush and for me? When you were gone,
    he graciously signified his intention of eating the cakes&mdash;brought the
    bag to me and emptied it without a drawback, from my hand, cake after
    cake. And I forgot the basket once again.
</p>
<p>
    And talking of Italy and the cardinals, and thinking of some cardinal
    points you are ignorant of, did you ever hear that I was one of

    whom your Dr. Donne would have put into the dykes? unless he meant the
    Baptists, instead of the Independents, the holders of the Independent
    church principle. No&mdash;not '<i>schismatical</i>,' I hope, hating as I do
    from the roots of my heart all that rending of the garment of Christ,
    which Christians are so apt to make the daily week-day of this
    Christianity so called&mdash;and caring very little for most dogmas and
    doxies in themselves&mdash;too little, as people say to me sometimes, (when
    they send me 'New Testaments' to learn from, with very kind
    intentions)&mdash;and believing that there is only one church in heaven and
    earth, with one divine High Priest to it; let exclusive religionists
    build what walls they please and bring out what chrisms. But I used to
    go with my father always, when I was able, to the nearest dissenting
    chapel of the Congregationalists&mdash;from liking the simplicity of that
    praying and speaking without books&mdash;and a little too from disliking
    the theory of state churches. There is a narrowness among the
    dissenters which is wonderful; an arid, grey Puritanism in the clefts
    of their souls: but it seems to me clear that they know what the
    'liberty of Christ' <i>means</i>, far better than those do who call
    themselves 'churchmen'; and stand altogether, as a body, on higher
    ground. And so, you see, when I talked of the sixteen points of my
    discourse, it was the foreshadowing of a coming event, and you have
    had it at last in the whole length and breadth of it. But it is not my
    fault if the wind began to blow so that I could not go out&mdash;as I
    intended&mdash;as I shall do to-morrow; and that you have received my
    dulness in a full libation of it, in consequence. My sisters said of
    the roses you blasphemed, yesterday, that they 'never saw such flowers
    anywhere&mdash;anywhere here in London&mdash;' and therefore if I had thought so
    myself before, it was not so wrong of me. I put your roses, you see,
    against my letter, to make it seem less dull&mdash;and yet I do not forget
    what you say about caring to hear from me&mdash;I mean, I do not <i>affect</i>
    to forget it.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you, far longer than I can say so.

<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, August 4, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I said what you comment on, about Mr. Kenyon, because I feel I <i>must</i>
    always tell you the simple truth&mdash;and not being quite at liberty to
    communicate the whole story (though it would at once clear me from the
    charge of over-curiosity ... if I much cared for <i>that</i>!)&mdash;I made my
    first request in order to prevent your getting at any part of it from
    <i>him</i> which should make my withholding seem disingenuous for the
    moment&mdash;that is, till my explanation came, if it had an opportunity of
    coming. And then, when I fancied you were misunderstanding the reason
    of that request&mdash;and supposing I was ambitious of making a higher
    figure in <i>his</i> eyes than your own,&mdash;I then felt it 'on my mind' and
    so spoke ... a natural mode of relief surely! For, dear friend, I have
    <i>once</i> been <i>untrue</i> to you&mdash;when, and how, and why, you know&mdash;but I
    thought it pedantry and worse to hold by my words and increase their
    fault. You have forgiven me that one mistake, and I only refer to it
    now because if you should ever make <i>that</i> a precedent, and put any
    least, most trivial word of mine under the same category, you would
    wrong me as you never wronged human being:&mdash;and that is done with. For
    the other matter,&mdash;the talk of my visits, it is impossible that any
    hint of them can ooze out of the only three persons in the world to
    whom I ever speak of them&mdash;my father, mother and sister&mdash;to whom my
    appreciation of your works is no novelty since some years, and whom I
    made comprehend exactly your position and the necessity for the
    absolute silence I enjoined respecting the permission to see you. You
    may depend on them,&mdash;and Miss Mitford is in your keeping, mind,&mdash;and
    dear Mr. Kenyon, if there should be never so gentle a touch of
    'garrulous God-innocence' about those kind lips of his. Come, let me
    snatch at <i>that</i> clue out of the maze, and say how perfect, absolutely
    perfect, are those three or four pages in the 'Vision' which present
    the Poets&mdash;a line, a few words, and the man there,&mdash;one twang of the
    bow and the arrowhead in the white&mdash;Shelley's 'white ideal all
    statue-blind' is&mdash;perfect,&mdash;how can I coin words? And dear deaf old
    Hesiod&mdash;and&mdash;all, all are perfect, perfect! But 'the Moon's regality
    will hear no praise'&mdash;well then, will she hear blame? Can it be you,
    my own you past putting away, <i>you</i> are a schismatic and frequenter of
    Independent Dissenting Chapels? And you confess this to <i>me</i>&mdash;whose
    father and mother went this morning to the very Independent Chapel
    where they took me, all those years back, to be baptised&mdash;and where
    they heard, this morning, a sermon preached by the very minister who
    officiated on that other occasion! Now will you be particularly
    encouraged by this successful instance to bring forward any other
    point of disunion between us that may occur to you? Please do not&mdash;for
    so sure as you begin proving that there is a gulf fixed between us, so
    sure shall I end proving that ... Anne Radcliffe avert it!... that you
    are just my sister: not that I am much frightened, but there are such
    surprises in novels!&mdash;Blame the next,&mdash;yes, now this <i>is</i> to be real
    blame!&mdash;And I meant to call your attention to it before. Why, why, do
    you blot out, in that unutterably provoking manner, whole lines, not
    to say words, in your letters&mdash;(and in the criticism on the
    'Duchess')&mdash;if it is a fact that you have a second thought, does it
    cease to be as genuine a fact, that first thought you please to
    efface? Why give a thing and take a thing? Is there no significance in
    putting on record that your first impression was to a certain effect
    and your next to a certain other, perhaps completely opposite one? If
    any proceeding of yours could go near to deserve that harsh word
    'impertinent' which you have twice, in speech and writing, been
    pleased to apply to your observations on me; certainly <i>this</i> does go
    as near as can be&mdash;as there is but one step to take from Southampton
    pier to New York quay, for travellers Westward. Now will you lay this
    to heart and perpend&mdash;lest in my righteous indignation I [some words
    effaced here]! For my own health&mdash;it improves, thank you! And I shall
    go abroad all in good time, never fear. For my 'Bells,' Mr. Chorley
    tells me there is no use in the world of printing them before November
    at earliest&mdash;and by that time I shall get done with these Romances and
    certainly one Tragedy (<i>that</i> could go to press next week)&mdash;in proof
    of which I will bring you, if you let me, a few more hundreds of lines
    next Wednesday. But, 'my poet,' if I would, as is true, sacrifice all
    my works to do your fingers, even, good&mdash;what would I not offer up to
    prevent you staying ... perhaps to correct my very verses ... perhaps
    read and answer my very letters ... staying the production of more
    'Berthas' and 'Caterinas' and 'Geraldines,' more great and beautiful
    poems of which I shall be&mdash;how proud! Do not be punctual in paying
    tithes of thyme, mint, anise and cummin, and leaving unpaid the real
    weighty dues of the Law; nor affect a scrupulous acknowledgment of
    'what you owe me' in petty manners, while you leave me to settle such
    a charge, as accessory to the hiding the Talent, as best I can! I have
    thought of this again and again, and would have spoken of it to you,
    had I ever felt myself fit to speak of any subject nearer home and me
    and you than Rome and Cardinal Acton. For, observe, you have not done
    ... yes, the 'Prometheus,' no doubt ... but with that exception <i>have</i>
    you written much lately, as much as last year when 'you wrote all your
    best things' you said, I think? Yet you are better now than then.
    Dearest friend, <i>I</i> intend to write more, and very likely be praised
    more, now I care less than ever for it, but still more do I look to
    have you ever before me, in your place, and with more poetry and more
    praise still, and my own heartfelt praise ever on the top, like a
    flower on the water. I have said nothing of yesterday's storm ...
    <i>thunder</i> ... may you not have been out in it! The evening draws in,
    and I will walk out. May God bless you, and let you hold me by the
    hand till the end&mdash;Yes, dearest friend!

<p>
    Just to show what may be lost by my crossings out, I will tell you the
    story of the one in the 'Duchess'&mdash;and in fact it is almost worth
    telling to a metaphysician like you, on other grounds, that you may
    draw perhaps some psychological good from the absurdity of it. Hear,
    then. When I had done writing the sheet of annotations and reflections
    on your poem I took up my pencil to correct the passages reflected on
    with the reflections, by the crosses you may observe, just glancing
    over the writing as I did so. Well! and, where that erasure is, I
    found a line purporting to be extracted from your 'Duchess,' with
    sundry acute criticisms and objections quite undeniably strong,
    following after it; only, to my amazement, as I looked and looked, the
    line so acutely objected to and purporting, as I say, to, be taken
    from the 'Duchess,' was by no means to be found in the 'Duchess,' ...
    nor anything like it, ... and I am certain indeed that, in the
    'Duchess' or out of it, you never wrote such a bad line in your life.
    And so it became a proved thing to me that I had been enacting, in a
    mystery, both poet and critic together&mdash;and one so neutralizing the
    other, that I took all that pains you remark upon to cross myself out
    in my double capacity, ... and am now telling the story of it
    notwithstanding. And there's an obvious moral to the myth, isn't
    there? for critics who bark the loudest, commonly bark at their own
    shadow in the glass, as my Flush used to do long and loud, before he
    gained experience and learnt the <span title="gnôthi seauton">&gamma;&nu;&omega;&theta;&iota; &sigma;&epsilon;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span> in the
    apparition of the brown dog with the glittering dilating eyes, ... and
    as <i>I</i> did, under the erasure. And another moral springs up of itself
    in this productive ground; for, you see, ... '<i>quand je m'efface il
    n'ya pas grand mal</i>.'
</p>
<p>
    And I am to be made to work very hard, am I? But you should remember
    that if I did as much writing as last summer, I should not be able to
    do much else, ... I mean, to go out and walk about ... for really I
    think I <i>could</i> manage to read your poems and write as I am writing
    now, with ever so much head-work of my own going on at the same time.
    But the bodily exercise is different, and I do confess that the
    novelty of living more in the outer life for the last few months than
    I have done for years before, make me idle and inclined to be
    idle&mdash;and everybody is idle sometimes&mdash;even <i>you</i> perhaps&mdash;are you
    not? For me, you know, I do carpet-work&mdash;ask Mrs. Jameson&mdash;and I never
    pretend to be in a perpetual motion of mental industry. Still it may
    not be quite as bad as you think: I have done some work since
    'Prometheus'&mdash;only it is nothing worth speaking of and not a part of
    the romance-poem which is to be some day if I live for it&mdash;lyrics for
    the most part, which lie written illegibly in pure Egyptian&mdash;oh, there
    is time enough, and too much perhaps! and so let me be idle a little
    now, and enjoy your poems while I can. It is pure enjoyment and must
    be&mdash;but you do not know how much, or you would not talk as you do
    sometimes ... so wide of any possible application.
</p>
<p>
    And do <i>not</i> talk again of what you would 'sacrifice' for <i>me</i>. If you
    affect me by it, which is true, you cast me from you farther than ever
    in the next thought. <i>That</i> is true.
</p>
<p>
    The poems ... yours ... which you left with me,&mdash;are full of various
    power and beauty and character, and you must let me have my own
    gladness from them in my own way.
</p>
<p>
    Now I must end this letter. Did you go to Chelsea and hear the divine
    philosophy?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Tell me the truth always</i> ... will you? I mean such truths as may be
    painful to me <i>though</i> truths....

    Then there is one more thing 'off my mind': I thought it might be with
    you as with <i>me</i>&mdash;not remembering how different are the causes that
    operate against us; different in kind as in degree:&mdash;<i>so</i> much reading
    hurts me, for instance,&mdash;whether the reading be light or heavy,
    fiction or fact, and <i>so</i> much writing, whether my own, such as you
    have seen, or the merest compliment-returning to the weary tribe that
    exact it of one. But your health&mdash;that before all!... as assuring all
    eventually ... and on the other accounts you must know! Never, pray,
    <i>pray</i>, never lose one sunny day or propitious hour to 'go out or walk
    about.' But do not surprise <i>me</i>, one of these mornings, by 'walking'
    up to me when I am introduced' ... or I shall infallibly, in spite of
    all the after repentance and begging pardon&mdash;I shall [words effaced].
    So here you learn the first 'painful truth' I have it in my power to
    tell you!

<p>
    I sent you the last of our poor roses this morning&mdash;considering that I
    fairly owed that kindness to them.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, I went to Chelsea and found dear Carlyle alone&mdash;his wife is in
    the country where he will join her as soon as his book's last sheet
    returns corrected and fit for press&mdash;which will be at the month's end
    about. He was all kindness and talked like his own self while he made
    me tea&mdash;and, afterward, brought chairs into the little yard, rather
    than garden, and smoked his pipe with apparent relish; at night he
    would walk as far as Vauxhall Bridge on my way home.
</p>
<p>
    If I used the word 'sacrifice,' you do well to object&mdash;I can imagine
    nothing ever to be done by me worthy such a name.

<p>
    It is very kind to send these flowers&mdash;too kind&mdash;why are they sent?
    and without one single word ... which is not too kind certainly. I
    looked down into the heart of the roses and turned the carnations over
    and over to the peril of their leaves, and in vain! Not a word do I
    deserve to-day, I suppose! And yet if I don't, I don't deserve the
    flowers either. There should have been an equal justice done to my
    demerits, O Zeus with the scales!
</p>
<p>
    After all I do thank you for these flowers&mdash;and they are
    beautiful&mdash;and they came just in a right current of time, just when I
    wanted them, or something like them&mdash;so I confess <i>that</i> humbly, and
    do thank you, at last, rather as I ought to do. Only you ought not to
    give away all the flowers of your garden to <i>me</i>; and your sister
    thinks so, be sure&mdash;if as silently as you sent them. Now I shall not
    write any more, not having been written to. What with the Wednesday's
    flowers and these, you may think how I in this room, look down on the
    gardens of Damascus, let <i>your Jew</i><a href="#note-20"><b>20</b></a> say what he pleases of
    <i>them</i>&mdash;and the Wednesday's flowers are as fresh and beautiful, I must
    explain, as the new ones. They were quite supererogatory ... the new
    ones ... in the sense of being flowers. Now, the sense of what I am
    writing seems questionable, does it not?&mdash;at least, more so, than the
    nonsense of it.

    How good you are to the smallest thing I try and do&mdash;(to show I
    <i>would</i> please you for an instant if I could, rather than from any
    hope such poor efforts as I am restricted to, can please you or
    ought.) And that you should care for the note that was not there!&mdash;But
    I was surprised by the summons to seal and deliver, since time and the
    carrier were peremptory&mdash;and so, I dared divine, almost, I should hear
    from you by our mid-day post&mdash;which happened&mdash;and the answer to
    <i>that</i>, you received on Friday night, did you not? I had to go to
    Holborn, of all places,&mdash;not to pluck strawberries in the Bishop's
    Garden like Richard Crouchback, but to get a book&mdash;and there I carried
    my note, thinking to expedite its delivery: this notelet of yours,
    quite as little in its kind as my blue flowers,&mdash;this came last
    evening&mdash;and here are my thanks, dear E.B.B.&mdash;dear friend.
</p>
<p>
    In the former note there is a phrase I must not forget to call on you
    to account for&mdash;that where it confesses to having done 'some
    work&mdash;only nothing worth speaking of.' Just see,&mdash;will you be first
    and only compact-breaker? Nor misunderstand me here, please, ... as I
    said, I am quite rejoiced that you go out now, 'walk about' now, and
    put off the writing that will follow thrice as abundantly, all because
    of the stopping to gather strength ... so I want no new word, not to
    say poem, not to say the romance-poem&mdash;let the 'finches in the
    shrubberies grow restless in the dark'&mdash;<i>I</i> am inside with the lights
    and music: but what is done, is done, <i>pas vrai</i>? And 'worth' is, dear
    my friend, pardon me, not in your arbitration quite.

<p>
    Let me tell you an odd thing that happened at Chorley's the other
    night. I must have mentioned to you that I forget my own verses so
    surely after they are once on paper, that I ought, without
    affectation, to mend them infinitely better, able as I am to bring
    fresh eyes to bear on them&mdash;(when I say 'once on paper' that is just
    what I mean and no more, for after the sad revising begins they do
    leave their mark, distinctly or less so according to circumstances).
    Well, Miss Cushman, the new American actress (clever and
    truthful-looking) was talking of a new novel by the Dane Andersen, he
    of the 'Improvisatore,' which will reach us, it should seem, in
    translation, <i>viâ</i> America&mdash;she had looked over two or three proofs of
    the work in the press, and Chorley was anxious to know something about
    its character. The title, she said, was capital&mdash;'Only a
    Fiddler!'&mdash;and she enlarged on that word, 'Only,' and its
    significance, so put: and I quite agreed with her for several minutes,
    till first one reminiscence flitted to me, then another and at last I
    was obliged to stop my praises and say 'but, now I think of it, <i>I</i>
    seem to have written something with a similar title&mdash;nay, a play, I
    believe&mdash;yes, and in five acts&mdash;'Only an Actress'&mdash;and from that
    time, some two years or more ago to this, I have been every way
    relieved of it'!&mdash;And when I got home, next morning, I made a dark
    pocket in my russet horror of a portfolio give up its dead, and there
    fronted me 'Only a Player-girl' (the real title) and the sayings and
    doings of her, and the others&mdash;such others! So I made haste and just
    tore out one sample-page, being Scene the First, and sent it to our
    friend as earnest and proof I had not been purely dreaming, as might
    seem to be the case. And what makes me recall it now is, that it was
    Russian, and about a fair on the Neva, and booths and droshkies and
    fish-pies and so forth, with the Palaces in the back ground. And in
    Chorley's <i>Athenæum</i> of yesterday you may read a paper of <i>very</i>
    simple moony stuff about the death of Alexander, and that Sir James
    Wylie I have seen at St. Petersburg (where he chose to mistake me for
    an Italian&mdash;'M. l'Italien' he said another time, looking up from his
    cards).... So I think to tell you.
</p>
<p>
    Now I may leave off&mdash;I shall see you start, on Tuesday&mdash;hear perhaps
    something definite about your travelling.
</p>
<p>
    Do you know, 'Consuelo' wearies me&mdash;oh, wearies&mdash;and the fourth volume
    I have all but stopped at&mdash;there lie the three following, but who
    cares about Consuelo after that horrible evening with the Venetian
    scamp, (where he bullies her, and it does answer, after all she says)
    as we say? And Albert wearies too&mdash;it seems all false, all
    writing&mdash;not the first part, though. And what easy work these
    novelists have of it! a Dramatic poet has to <i>make</i> you love or admire
    his men and women,&mdash;they must <i>do</i> and <i>say</i> all that you are to see
    and hear&mdash;really do it in your face, say it in your ears, and it is
    wholly for <i>you</i>, in <i>your</i> power, to <i>name</i>, characterize and so
    praise or blame, <i>what</i> is so said and done ... if you don't perceive
    of yourself, there is no standing by, for the Author, and telling you.
    But with these novelists, a scrape of the pen&mdash;out blurting of a
    phrase, and the miracle is achieved&mdash;'Consuelo possessed to perfection
    this and the other gift'&mdash;what would you more? Or, to leave dear
    George Sand, pray think of Bulwer's beginning a 'character' by
    informing you that lone, or somebody in 'Pompeii,' 'was endowed with
    <i>perfect</i> genius'&mdash;'genius'! What though the obliging informer might
    write his fingers off before he gave the pitifullest proof that the
    poorest spark of that same, that genius, had ever visited <i>him</i>?
    <i>Ione</i> has it '<i>perfectly</i>'&mdash;perfectly&mdash;and that is enough! Zeus with
    the scales? with the false weights!
</p>
<p>
    And now&mdash;till Tuesday good-bye, and be willing to get well as (letting
    me send <i>porter</i> instead of flowers&mdash;and beefsteaks too!) soon as may
    be! and may God bless you, ever dear friend.

<p>
    But if it 'hurts' you to read and write ever so little, why should I
    be asked to write ... for instance ... 'before Tuesday?' And I did
    mean to say before to-day, that I wish you never would write to me
    when you are not <i>quite well</i>, as once or twice you have done if not
    much oftener; because there is not a necessity, ... and I do not
    choose that there should ever be, or <i>seem</i> a necessity, ... do you
    understand? And as a matter of personal preference, it is natural for
    me to like the silence that does not hurt you, better than the speech
    that does. And so, remember.
</p>
<p>
    And talking of what may 'hurt' you and me, you would smile, as I have
    often done in the midst of my vexation, if you knew the persecution I
    have been subjected to by the people who call themselves (<i>lucus a non
    lucendo</i>) 'the faculty,' and set themselves against the exercise of
    other people's faculties, as a sure way to death and destruction. The
    modesty and simplicity with which one's physicians tell one not to
    think or feel, just as they would tell one not to walk out in the dew,
    would be quite amusing, if it were not too tryingly stupid sometimes.
    I had a doctor once who thought he had done everything because he had
    carried the inkstand out of the room&mdash;'Now,' he said, 'you will have
    such a pulse to-morrow.' He gravely thought poetry a sort of
    disease&mdash;a sort of fungus of the brain&mdash;and held as a serious opinion,
    that nobody could be properly well who exercised it as an art&mdash;which
    was true (he maintained) even of men&mdash;he had studied the physiology of
    poets, 'quotha'&mdash;but that for women, it was a mortal malady and
    incompatible with any common show of health under any circumstances.
    And then came the damnatory clause in his experience ... that he had
    never known 'a system' approaching mine in 'excitability' ... except
    Miss Garrow's ... a young lady who wrote verses for Lady Blessington's
    annuals ... and who was the only other female rhymer he had had the
    misfortune of attending. And she was to die in two years, though she
    was dancing quadrilles then (and has lived to do the same by the
    polka), and <i>I</i>, of course, much sooner, if I did not ponder these
    things, and amend my ways, and take to reading 'a course of history'!!
    Indeed I do not exaggerate. And just so, for a long while I was
    persecuted and pestered ... vexed thoroughly sometimes ... my own
    family, instructed to sing the burden out all day long&mdash;until the time
    when the subject was suddenly changed by my heart being broken by that
    great stone that fell out of Heaven. Afterwards I was let do anything
    I could best ... which was very little, until last year&mdash;and the
    working, last year, did much for me in giving me stronger roots down
    into life, ... much. But think of that absurd reasoning that went
    before!&mdash;the <i>niaiserie</i> of it! For, granting all the premises all
    round, it is not the <i>utterance</i> of a thought that <i>can</i> hurt anybody;
    while only the utterance is dependent on the will; and so, what can
    the taking away of an inkstand do? Those physicians are such
    metaphysicians! It's curious to listen to them. And it's wise to leave
    off listening: though I have met with excessive kindness among them,
    ... and do not refer to Dr. Chambers in any of this, of course.
</p>
<p>
    I am very glad you went to Chelsea&mdash;and it seemed finer afterwards, on
    purpose to make room for the divine philosophy. Which reminds me (the
    going to Chelsea) that my brother Henry confessed to me yesterday,
    with shame and confusion of face, to having mistaken and taken your
    umbrella for another belonging to a cousin of ours then in the house.
    He saw you ... without conjecturing, just at the moment, who you were.
    Do <i>you</i> conjecture sometimes that I live all alone here like Mariana
    in the moated Grange? It is not quite so&mdash;: but where there are many,
    as with us, every one is apt to follow his own devices&mdash;and my father
    is out all day and my brothers and sisters are in and out, and with
    too large a public of noisy friends for me to bear, ... and I see them
    only at certain hours, ... except, of course, my sisters. And then as
    you have 'a reputation' and are opined to talk generally in blank
    verse, it is not likely that there should be much irreverent rushing
    into this room when you are known to be in it.
</p>
<p>
    The flowers are ... so beautiful! Indeed it was wrong, though, to send
    me the last. It was not just to the lawful possessors and enjoyers of
    them. That it was kind to <i>me</i> I do not forget.
</p>
<p>
    You are too teachable a pupil in the art of obliterating&mdash;and <i>omne
    ignotum pro terrifico</i> ... and therefore I won't frighten you by
    walking to meet you for fear of being frightened myself.
</p>
<p>
    So good-bye until Tuesday. I ought not to make you read all this, I
    know, whether you like to read it or not: and I ought not to have
    written it, having no better reason than because I like to write on
    and on. <i>You</i> have better reasons for thinking me very weak&mdash;and I,
    too good ones for not being able to reproach you for that natural and
    necessary opinion.

<p>
    Yes, I admit that it was stupid to read that word so wrong. I thought
    there was a mistake somewhere, but that it was <i>yours</i>, who had
    written one word, meaning to write another. 'Cower' puts it all right
    of course. But is there an English word of a significance different
    from 'stamp,' in 'stomp?' Does not the old word King Lud's men
    stomped withal, claim identity with our 'stamping.' The <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>
    used to 'change about,' you know, in the old English writers&mdash;see
    Chaucer for it. Still the 'stomp' with the peculiar significance, is
    better of course than the 'stamp' even with a rhyme ready for it, and
    I dare say you are justified in daring to put this old wine into the
    new bottle; and we will drink to the health of the poem in it. It <i>is</i>
    'Italy in England'&mdash;isn't it? But I understand and understood
    perfectly, through it all, that it is <i>unfinished</i>, and in a rough
    state round the edges. I could not help seeing <i>that</i>, even if I were
    still blinder than when I read 'Lower' for 'Cower.'
</p>
<p>
    But do not, I ask of you, speak of my 'kindness' ... my
    kindness!&mdash;mine! It is 'wasteful and ridiculous excess' and
    mis-application to use such words of me. And therefore, talking of
    'compacts' and the 'fas' and 'nefas' of them, I entreat you to know
    for the future that whatever I write of your poetry, if it isn't to be
    called 'impertinence,' isn't to be called 'kindness,' any more, ... <i>a
    fortiori</i>, as people say when they are sure of an argument. Now, will
    you try to understand?
</p>
<p>
    And talking still of compacts, how and where did I break any compact?
    I do not see.
</p>
<p>
    It was very curious, the phenomenon about your 'Only a Player-Girl.'
    What an un-godlike indifference to your creatures though&mdash;your worlds,
    breathed away from you like soap bubbles, and dropping and breaking
    into russet portfolios unobserved! Only a god for the Epicurean, at
    best, can you be? That Miss Cushman went to Three Mile Cross the other
    day, and visited Miss Mitford, and pleased her a good deal, I fancied
    from what she said, ... and with reason, from what <i>you</i> say. And
    'Only a Fiddler,' as I forgot to tell you yesterday, is announced, you
    may see in any newspaper, as about to issue from the English press by
    Mary Howitt's editorship. So we need not go to America for it. But if
    you complain of George Sand for want of art, how could you bear
    Andersen, who can see a thing under his eyes and place it under yours,
    and take a thought separately into his soul and express it insularly,
    but has no sort of instinct towards wholeness and unity; and writes a
    book by putting so many pages together, ... just so!&mdash;For the rest,
    there can be no disagreeing with you about the comparative difficulty
    of novel-writing and drama-writing. I disagree a little, lower down in
    your letter, because I could not deny (in my own convictions) a
    certain proportion of genius to the author of 'Ernest Maltravers,' and
    'Alice' (did you ever read those books?), even if he had more
    impotently tried (supposing it to be possible) for the dramatic
    laurel. In fact his poetry, dramatic or otherwise, is 'nought'; but
    for the prose romances, and for 'Ernest Maltravers' above all, I must
    lift up my voice and cry. And I read the <i>Athenæum</i> about your Sir
    James Wylie who took you for an Italian....

<p>
    Do you know, dear friend, it is no good policy to stop up all the
    vents of my feeling, nor leave one for safety's sake, as you will do,
    let me caution you never so repeatedly. I know, quite well enough,
    that your 'kindness' is not <i>so</i> apparent, even, in this instance of
    correcting my verses, as in many other points&mdash;but on such points, you
    lift a finger to me and I am dumb.... Am I not to be allowed a word
    here neither?
</p>
<p>
    I remember, in the first season of German Opera here, when 'Fidelio's'
    effects were going, going up to the gallery in order to get the best
    of the last chorus&mdash;get its oneness which you do&mdash;and, while perched
    there an inch under the ceiling, I was amused with the enormous
    enthusiasm of an elderly German (we thought,&mdash;I and a cousin of
    mine)&mdash;whose whole body broke out in billow, heaved and swayed in the
    perfection of his delight, hands, head, feet, all tossing and striving
    to utter what possessed him. Well&mdash;next week, we went again to the
    Opera, and again mounted at the proper time, but the crowd was
    <i>greater</i>, and our mild great faced white haired red cheeked German
    was not to be seen, not at first&mdash;for as the glory was at its full, my
    cousin twisted me round and made me see an arm, only an arm, all the
    body of its owner being amalgamated with a dense crowd on each side,
    before, and&mdash;not behind, because they, the crowd, occupied the last
    benches, over which we looked&mdash;and this arm waved and exulted as if
    'for the dignity of the whole body,'&mdash;relieved it of its dangerous
    accumulation of repressed excitability. When the crowd broke up all
    the rest of the man disengaged itself by slow endeavours, and there
    stood our friend confessed&mdash;as we were sure!
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;Now, you would have bade him keep his arm quiet? 'Lady Geraldine,
    you <i>would</i>!'
</p>
<p>
    I have read those novels&mdash;but I must keep that word of words,
    'genius'&mdash;for something different&mdash;'talent' will do here surely.
</p>
<p>
    There lies 'Consuelo'&mdash;done with!
</p>
<p>
    I shall tell you frankly that it strikes me as precisely what in
    conventional language with the customary silliness is styled a
    <i>woman's</i> book, in its merits and defects,&mdash;and supremely timid in all
    the points where one wants, and has a right to expect, some <i>fruit</i> of
    all the pretence and George Sand<i>ism</i>. These are occasions when one
    does say, in the phrase of her school, 'que la Femme parle!' or what
    is better, let her act! and how does Consuelo comfort herself on such
    an emergency? Why, she bravely lets the uninspired people throw down
    one by one their dearest prejudices at her feet, and then, like a
    very actress, picks them up, like so many flowers, returning them to
    the breast of the owners with a smile and a courtesy and trips off the
    stage with a glance at the Pit. Count Christian, Baron Frederic,
    Baroness&mdash;what is her name&mdash;all open their arms, and Consuelo will not
    consent to entail disgrace &amp;c. &amp;c. No, you say&mdash;she leaves them in
    order to solve the problem of her true feeling, whether she can really
    love Albert; but remember that this is done, (that is, so much of it
    as ever <i>is</i> done, and as determines her to accept his hand at the
    very last)&mdash;this is solved sometime about the next morning&mdash;or
    earlier&mdash;I forget&mdash;and in the meantime, Albert gets that 'benefit of
    the doubt' of which chapter the last informs you. As for the
    hesitation and self examination on the matter of that Anzoleto&mdash;the
    writer is turning over the leaves of a wrong dictionary, seeking help
    from Psychology, and pretending to forget there is such a thing as
    Physiology. Then, that horrible Porpora:&mdash;if George Sand gives <i>him</i>
    to a Consuelo for an absolute master, in consideration of his services
    specified, and is of opinion that <i>they</i> warrant his conduct, or at
    least, oblige submission to it,&mdash;then, I find her objections to the
    fatherly rule of Frederic perfectly impertinent&mdash;he having a few
    claims upon the gratitude of Prussia also, in his way, I believe! If
    the strong ones <i>will make</i> the weak ones lead them&mdash;then, for
    Heaven's sake, let this dear old all-abused world keep on its course
    without these outcries and tearings of hair, and don't be for ever
    goading the Karls and other trodden-down creatures till they get their
    carbines in order (very rationally) to abate the nuisance&mdash;when you
    make the man a long speech against some enormity he is about to
    commit, and adjure and beseech and so forth, till he throws down the
    aforesaid carbine, falls on his knees, and lets the Frederic go
    quietly on his way to keep on killing his thousands after the fashion
    that moved your previous indignation. Now is that right,
    consequential&mdash;that is, <i>inferential</i>; logically deduced, going
    straight to the end&mdash;<i>manly</i>?
</p>
<p>
    The accessories are not the Principal, the adjuncts&mdash;the essence, nor
    the ornamental incidents the book's self, so what matters it if the
    portraits are admirable, the descriptions eloquent, (eloquent, there
    it is&mdash;that is her characteristic&mdash;what she <i>has</i> to speak, she
    <i>speaks out</i>, speaks volubly <i>forth</i>, too well, inasmuch as you say,
    advancing a step or two, 'And now speak as completely <i>here</i>'&mdash;and she
    says nothing)&mdash;but all <i>that</i>, another could do, as others have
    done&mdash;but 'la femme qui parle'&mdash;Ah, that, is <i>this</i> all? So I am not
    George Sand's&mdash;she teaches me nothing&mdash;I look to her for nothing.
</p>

    But what likeness is there between opposites; and what has 'M.
    l'Italien' to do with the said 'elderly German'? See how little! For
    to bring your case into point, somebody should have been playing on a
    Jew's harp for the whole of the orchestra; and the elderly German
    should have quoted something about 'Harp of Judah' to the Venetian
    behind him! And there, you would have proved your analogy!&mdash;Because
    you see, my dear friend, it was not the expression, but the thing
    expressed, I cried out against&mdash;the exaggeration in your mind. I am
    sorry when I write what you do not like&mdash;but I have instincts and
    impulses too strong for me when you say things which put me into such
    a miserably false position in respect to you&mdash;as for instance, when in
    this very last letter (oh, I <i>must</i> tell you!) you talk of my
    'correcting your verses'! My correcting your verses!!!&mdash;Now is <i>that</i>
    a thing for you to say?&mdash;And do you really imagine that if I kept that
    happily imagined phrase in my thoughts, I should be able to tell you
    one word of my impressions from your poetry, ever, ever again? Do you
    not see at once what a disqualifying and paralysing phrase it must be,
    of simple necessity? So it is <i>I</i> who have reason to complain, ... it
    appears to <i>me</i>, ... and by no means <i>you</i>&mdash;and in your 'second
    consideration' you become aware of it, I do not at all doubt.
</p>
<p>
    As to 'Consuelo' I agree with nearly all that you say of it&mdash;though
    George Sand, we are to remember, is greater than 'Consuelo,' and not
    to be depreciated according to the defects of that book, nor
    classified as 'femme qui parle' ... she who is man and woman together,
    ... judging her by the standard of even that book in the nobler
    portions of it. For the inconsequency of much in the book, I admit it
    of course&mdash;and <i>you</i> will admit that it is the rarest of phenomena
    when men ... men of logic ... follow their own opinions into their
    obvious results&mdash;nobody, you know, ever thinks of doing such a thing:
    to pursue one's own inferences is to rush in where angels ... perhaps
    ... do <i>not</i> fear to tread, ... but where there will not be much other
    company. So the want of practical logic shall be a human fault rather
    than a womanly one, if you please: and you must please also to
    remember that 'Consuelo' is only 'half the orange'; and that when you
    complain of its not being a whole one, you overlook that hand which is
    holding to you the 'Comtesse de Rudolstadt' in three volumes! Not that
    I, who have read the whole, profess a full satisfaction about Albert
    and the rest&mdash;and Consuelo is made to be happy by a mere clap-trap at
    last: and Mme. Dudevant has her specialities,&mdash;in which, other women,
    I fancy, have neither part nor lot, ... even <i>here</i>!&mdash;Altogether, the
    book is a sort of rambling 'Odyssey,' a female 'Odyssey,' if you like,
    but full of beauty and nobleness, let the faults be where they may.
    And then, I like those long, long books, one can live away into ...
    leaving the world and above all oneself, quite at the end of the
    avenue of palms&mdash;quite out of sight and out of hearing!&mdash;Oh, I have
    felt something like <i>that</i> so often&mdash;so often! and <i>you</i> never felt
    it, and never will, I hope.

    But if Bulwer had written nothing but the 'Ernest Maltravers' books,
    you would think perhaps more highly of him. Do you <i>not</i> think it
    possible now? It is his most impotent struggling into poetry, which
    sets about proving a negative of genius on him&mdash;<i>that</i>, which the
    <i>Athenæum praises</i> as 'respectable attainment in various walks of
    literature'&mdash;! <i>like</i> the <i>Athenæum</i>, isn't it? and worthy praise, to
    be administered by professed judges of art? What is to be expected of
    the public, when the teachers of the public teach <i>so</i>?&mdash;

    When you come on Tuesday, do not forget the MS. if any is done&mdash;only

    I am going to propose to you to give up Tuesday, and to take your
    choice of two or three other days, say Friday, or Saturday, or
    to-morrow ... Monday. Mr. Kenyon was here to-day and talked of leaving
    London on Friday, and of visiting me again on 'Tuesday' ... he said,
    ... but that is an uncertainty, and it may be Tuesday or Wednesday or
    Thursday. So I thought (wrong or right) that out of the three
    remaining days you would not mind choosing one. And if you do choose
    the Monday, there will be no need to write&mdash;nor time indeed&mdash;; but if
    the Friday or Saturday, I shall hear from you, perhaps. Above all
    things remember, my dear friend, that I shall not expect you
    to-morrow, except as by a <i>bare possibility</i>. In great haste, signed

    I fancied it was just <i>so</i>&mdash;as I did not hear and did not see you on
    Monday. Not that you were expected particularly&mdash;but that you would
    have written your own negative, it appeared to me, by some post in the
    day, if you had received my note in time. It happened well too,
    altogether, as you have a friend with you, though Mr. Kenyon does not
    come, and will not come, I dare say; for he spoke like a doubter at
    the moment; and as this Tuesday wears on, I am not likely to have any
    visitors on it after all, and may as well, if the rain quite ceases,
    go and spend my solitude on the park a little. Flush wags his tail at
    that proposition when I speak it loud out. And I am to write to you
    before Friday, and so, am writing, you see ... which I should not,
    should not have done if I had not been told; because it is not my turn
    to write, ... did you think it was?
</p>
<p>
    Not a word of Malta! except from Mr. Kenyon who talked homilies of it
    last Sunday and wanted to speak them to Papa&mdash;but it would not do in
    any way&mdash;now especially&mdash;and in a little time there will be a
    decision for or against; and I am afraid of <i>both</i> ... which is a
    happy state of preparation. Did I not tell you that early in the
    summer I did some translations for Miss Thomson's 'Classical Album,'
    from Bion and Theocritus, and Nonnus the author of that large (not
    great) poem in some forty books of the 'Dionysiaca' ... and the
    paraphrases from Apuleius? Well&mdash;I had a letter from her the other
    day, full of compunction and ejaculation, and declaring the fact that
    Mr. Burges had been correcting all the proofs of the poems; leaving
    out and emending generally, according to his own particular idea of
    the pattern in the mount&mdash;is it not amusing? I have been wicked enough
    to write in reply that it is happy for her and all readers ... <i>sua si
    bona norint</i> ... if during some half hour which otherwise might have
    been dedicated by Mr. Burges to patting out the lights of Sophocles
    and his peers, he was satisfied with the humbler devastation of E.B.B.
    upon Nonnus. You know it is impossible to help being amused. This
    correcting is a mania with that man! And then I, who wrote what I did
    from the 'Dionysiaca,' with no respect for 'my author,' and an
    arbitrary will to 'put the case' of Bacchus and Ariadne as well as I
    could, for the sake of the art-illustrations, ... those subjects Miss
    Thomson sent me, ... and did it all with full liberty and persuasion
    of soul that nobody would think it worth while to compare English with
    Greek and refer me back to Nonnus and detect my wanderings from the
    text!! But the critic was not to be cheated so! And I do not doubt
    that he has set me all 'to rights' from beginning to end; and combed
    Ariadne's hair close to her cheeks for me. Have <i>you</i> known Nonnus,
    ... <i>you</i> who forget nothing? and have known everything, I think? For
    it is quite startling, I must tell you, quite startling and
    humiliating, to observe how you combine such large tracts of
    experience of outer and inner life, of books and men, of the world and
    the arts of it; curious knowledge as well as general knowledge ... and
    deep thinking as well as wide acquisition, ... and you, looking none
    the older for it all!&mdash;yes, and being besides a man of genius and
    working your faculty and not wasting yourself over a surface or away
    from an end. Dugald Stewart said that genius made naturally a
    lop-sided mind&mdash;did he not? He ought to have known <i>you</i>. And <i>I</i> who
    do ... a little ... (for I grow more loth than I was to assume the
    knowledge of you, my dear friend)&mdash;<i>I</i> do not mean to use that word
    'humiliation' in the sense of having felt the thing myself in any
    <i>painful</i> way, ... because I never for a moment did, or <i>could</i>, you
    know,&mdash;never could ... never did ... except indeed when you have over
    praised me, which forced another personal feeling in. Otherwise it has
    always been quite pleasant to me to be 'startled and humiliated'&mdash;and
    more so perhaps than to be startled and exalted, if I might choose....
</p>
<p>
    Only I did not mean to write all this, though you told me to write to
    you. But the rain which keeps one in, gives one an example of pouring
    on ... and you must endure as you can or will. Also ... as you have a
    friend with you 'from Italy' ... 'from Rome,' and commended me for my
    'kindness and considerateness' in changing Tuesday to Friday ...
    (wasn't it?...) shall I still be more considerate and put off the
    visit-day to next week? mind, you let it be as you like it best to
    be&mdash;I mean, as is most convenient 'for the nonce' to you and your
    friend&mdash;because all days are equal, as to that matter of convenience,

<p>
    I feel at home, this blue early morning, now that I sit down to write
    (or, <i>speak</i>, as I try and fancy) to you, after a whole day with those
    'other friends'&mdash;dear good souls, whom I should be so glad to serve,
    and to whom service must go by way of last will and testament, if a
    few more hours of 'social joy,' 'kindly intercourse,' &amp;c., fall to my
    portion. My friend the Countess began proceedings (when I first saw
    her, not yesterday) by asking 'if I had got as much money as I
    expected by any works published of late?'&mdash;to which I answered, of
    course, 'exactly as much'&mdash;<i>è grazioso</i>! (All the same, if you were to
    ask her, or the like of her, 'how much the stone-work of the Coliseum
    would fetch, properly burned down to lime?'&mdash;she would shudder from
    head to foot and call you 'barbaro' with good Trojan heart.) Now you
    suppose&mdash;(watch my rhetorical figure here)&mdash;you suppose I am going to
    congratulate myself on being so much for the better, <i>en pays de
    connaissance</i>, with my 'other friend,' E.B.B., number 2&mdash;or 200, why
    not?&mdash;whereas I mean to 'fulmine over Greece,' since thunder frightens
    you, for all the laurels,&mdash;and to have reason for your taking my own
    part and lot to yourself&mdash;I do, will, must, and <i>will</i>, again, wonder
    at <i>you</i> and admire <i>you</i>, and so on to the climax. It is a fixed,
    immovable thing: so fixed that I can well forego talking about it. But
    if to talk you once begin, 'the King shall enjoy (or receive quietly)
    his own again'&mdash;I wear no bright weapon out of that Panoply ... or
    Panoplite, as I think you call Nonnus, nor ever, like Leigh Hunt's
    'Johnny, ever blythe and bonny, went singing Nonny, nonny' and see
    to-morrow, what a vengeance I will take for your 'mere suspicion in
    that kind'! But to the serious matter ... nay, I said yesterday, I
    believe&mdash;keep off that Burgess&mdash;he is stark staring mad&mdash;mad, do you
    know? The last time I met him he told me he had recovered I forget how
    many of the lost books of Thucydides&mdash;found them imbedded in Suidas (I
    think), and had disengaged them from <i>his</i> Greek, without loss of a
    letter, 'by an instinct he, Burgess, had'&mdash;(I spell his name wrongly
    to help the proper <i>hiss</i> at the end). Then, once on a time, he found
    in the 'Christus Patiens,' an odd dozen of lines, clearly dropped out
    of the 'Prometheus,' and proving that Æschylus was aware of the
    invention of gunpowder. He wanted to help Dr. Leonhard Schmitz in his
    'Museum'&mdash;and scared him, as Schmitz told me. What business has he,
    Burges, with English verse&mdash;and what on earth, or under it, has Miss
    Thomson to do with <i>him</i>. If she must displease one of two, why is Mr.
    B. not to be thanked and 'sent to feed,' as the French say prettily?
    At all events, do pray see what he has presumed to alter ... you can
    alter at sufficient warrant, profit by suggestion, I should think! But
    it is all Miss Thomson's shame and fault: because she is quite in her
    propriety, saying to such intermeddlers, gently for the sake of their
    poor weak heads, 'very good, I dare say, very desirable emendations,
    only the work is not mine, you know, but my friend's, and you must no
    more alter it without her leave, than alter this sketch, this
    illustration, because you think you could mend Ariadne's face or
    figure,&mdash;Fecit Tizianus, scripsit E.B.B.' Dear friend, you will tell
    Miss Thomson to stop further proceedings, will you not? There! only,
    do mind what I say?
</p>
<p>
    And now&mdash;till to-morrow! It seems an age since I saw you. I want to
    catch our first post ... (this phrase I ought to get stereotyped&mdash;I
    need it so constantly). The day is fine ... you will profit by it, I
    trust. 'Flush, wag your tail and grow restless and scratch at the
    door!'

<p>
    But what have <i>I</i> done that you should ask what have <i>you</i> done? I
    have not brought any accusation, have I ... no, nor <i>thought</i> any, I
    am sure&mdash;and it was only the 'kindness and considerateness'&mdash;argument
    that was irresistible as a thing to be retorted, when your thanks came
    so naturally and just at the corner of an application. And then, you
    know, it is gravely true, seriously true, sadly true, that I am always
    expecting to hear or to see how tired you are at last of me!&mdash;sooner
    or later, you know!&mdash;But I did not mean any seriousness in that
    letter. No, nor did I mean ... (to pass to another question ...) to
    provoke you to the
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mister Hayley ... so are <i>you</i>....
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">
    reply complimentary. All I observed concerning yourself, was the
    <i>combination</i>&mdash;which not an idiom in chivalry could treat
    grammatically as a thing common to <i>me</i> and you, inasmuch as everyone
    who has known me for half a day, may know that, if there is anything
    peculiar in me, it lies for the most part in an extraordinary
    deficiency in this and this and this, ... there is no need to describe
    what. Only nuns of the strictest sect of the nunneries are rather
    wiser in some points, and have led less restricted lives than I have
    in others. And if it had not been for my 'carpet-work'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Well&mdash;and do you know that I have, for the last few years, taken quite
    to despise book-knowledge and its effect on the mind&mdash;I mean when
    people <i>live by it</i> as most readers by profession do, ... cloistering
    their souls under these roofs made with heads, when they might be
    under the sky. Such people grow dark and narrow and low, with all
    their pains.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I was writing you see before you came&mdash;and now I go on in
    haste to speak 'off my mind' some things which are on it. First ... of
    yourself; how can it be that you are unwell again, ... and that you
    should talk (now did you not?&mdash;did I not hear you say so?) of being
    'weary in your soul' ... <i>you</i>? What should make <i>you</i>, dearest
    friend, weary in your soul; or out of spirits in any way?&mdash;Do ... tell
    me.... I was going to write without a pause&mdash;and almost I might,
    perhaps, ... even as one of the two hundred of your friends, ...
    almost I might say out that 'Do tell me.' Or is it (which I am
    inclined to think most probable) that you are tired of a same life and
    want change? It may happen to anyone sometimes, and is independent of
    your will and choice, you know&mdash;and I know, and the whole world knows:
    and would it not therefore be wise of you, in that case, to fold your
    life new again and go abroad at once? What can make you weary in your
    soul, is a problem to me. You are the last from whom I should have
    expected such a word. And you did say so, I <i>think</i>. I <i>think</i> that it
    was not a mistake of mine. And <i>you</i>, ... with a full liberty, and the
    world in your hand for every purpose and pleasure of it!&mdash;Or is it
    that, being unwell, your spirits are affected by <i>that</i>? But then you
    might be more unwell than you like to admit&mdash;. And I am teasing you
    with talking of it ... am I not?&mdash;and being disagreeable is only one
    third of the way towards being useful, it is good to remember in time.
</p>
<p>
    And then the next thing to write off my mind is ... that you must not,
    you must not, make an unjust opinion out of what I said to-day. I have
    been uncomfortable since, lest you should&mdash;and perhaps it would have
    been better if I had not said it apart from all context in that way;
    only that you could not long be a friend of mine without knowing and
    seeing what so lies on the surface. But then, ... as far as I am
    concerned, ... no one cares less for a 'will' than I do (and this
    though I never had one, ... in clear opposition to your theory which
    holds generally nevertheless) for a will in the common things of life.
    Every now and then there must of course be a crossing and
    vexation&mdash;but in one's mere pleasures and fantasies, one would rather
    be crossed and vexed a little than vex a person one loves ... and it
    is possible to get used to the harness and run easily in it at last;
    and there is a side-world to hide one's thoughts in, and 'carpet-work'
    to be immoral on in spite of Mrs. Jameson, ... and the word
    'literature' has, with me, covered a good deal of liberty as you must
    see ... real liberty which is never enquired into&mdash;and it has happened
    throughout my life by an accident (as far as anything is accident)
    that my own sense of right and happiness on any important point of
    overt action, has never run contrariwise to the way of obedience
    required of me ... while in things not exactly <i>overt</i>, I and all of
    us are apt to act sometimes up to the limit of our means of acting,
    with shut doors and windows, and no waiting for cognisance or
    permission. Ah&mdash;and that last is the worst of it all perhaps! to be
    forced into concealments from the heart naturally nearest to us; and
    forced away from the natural source of counsel and strength!&mdash;and
    then, the disingenuousness&mdash;the cowardice&mdash;the 'vices of
    slaves'!&mdash;and everyone you see ... all my brothers, ... constrained
    <i>bodily</i> into submission ... apparent submission at least ... by that
    worst and most dishonouring of necessities, the necessity of <i>living</i>,
    everyone of them all, except myself, being dependent in money-matters
    on the inflexible will ... do you see? But what you do <i>not</i> see, what
    you <i>cannot</i> see, is the deep tender affection behind and below all
    those patriarchal ideas of governing grown up children 'in the way
    they <i>must</i> go!' and there never was (under the strata) a truer
    affection in a father's heart ... no, nor a worthier heart in itself
    ... a heart loyaller and purer, and more compelling to gratitude and
    reverence, than his, as I see it! The evil is in the system&mdash;and he
    simply takes it to be his duty to rule, and to make happy according to
    his own views of the propriety of happiness&mdash;he takes it to be his
    duty to rule like the Kings of Christendom, by divine right. But he
    loves us through and through it&mdash;and <i>I</i>, for one, love <i>him</i>! and
    when, five years ago, I lost what I loved best in the world beyond
    comparison and rivalship ... far better than himself as he knew ...
    for everyone who knew <i>me</i> could not choose but know what was my first
    and chiefest affection ... when I lost <i>that</i>, ... I felt that he
    stood the nearest to me on the closed grave ... or by the unclosing
    sea ... I do not know which nor could ask. And I will tell you that
    not only he has been kind and patient and forbearing to me through the
    tedious trial of this illness (far more trying to standers by than you
    have an idea of perhaps) but that he was generous and forbearing in
    that hour of bitter trial, and never reproached me as he might have
    done and as my own soul has not spared&mdash;never once said to me then or
    since, that if it had not been for <i>me</i>, the crown of his house would
    not have fallen. He <i>never did</i> ... and he might have said it, and
    more&mdash;and I could have answered nothing. Nothing, except that I had
    paid my own price&mdash;and that the price I paid was greater than his
    <i>loss</i> ... his!! For see how it was; and how, 'not with my hand but
    heart,' I was the cause or occasion of that misery&mdash;and though not
    with the intention of my heart but with its weakness, yet the
    <i>occasion</i>, any way!
</p>
<p>
    They sent me down you know to Torquay&mdash;Dr. Chambers saying that I
    could not live a winter in London. The worst&mdash;what people call the
    worst&mdash;was apprehended for me at that time. So I was sent down with my
    sister to my aunt there&mdash;and he, my brother whom I loved so, was sent
    too, to take us there and return. And when the time came for him to
    leave me, <i>I</i>, to whom he was the dearest of friends and brothers in
    one ... the only one of my family who ... well, but I cannot write of
    these things; and it is enough to tell you that he was above us all,
    better than us all, and kindest and noblest and dearest to <i>me</i>,
    beyond comparison, any comparison, as I said&mdash;and when the time came
    for him to leave me <i>I</i>, weakened by illness, could not master my
    spirits or drive back my tears&mdash;and my aunt kissed them away instead
    of reproving me as she should have done; and said that <i>she</i> would
    take care that I should not be grieved ... <i>she</i>! ... and so she sate
    down and wrote a letter to Papa to tell him that he would 'break my
    heart' if he persisted in calling away my brother&mdash;As if hearts were
    broken <i>so</i>! I have thought bitterly since that my heart did not break
    for a good deal more than <i>that</i>! And Papa's answer was&mdash;burnt into
    me, as with fire, it is&mdash;that 'under such circumstances he did not
    refuse to suspend his purpose, but that he considered it to be <i>very
    wrong in me to exact such a thing</i>.' So there was no separation
    <i>then</i>: and month after month passed&mdash;and sometimes I was better and
    sometimes worse&mdash;and the medical men continued to say that they would
    not answer for my life ... they! if I were agitated&mdash;and so there was
    no more talk of a separation. And once <i>he</i> held my hand, ... how I
    remember! and said that he 'loved me better than them all and that he
    <i>would not</i> leave me ... till I was well,' he said! how I remember
    <i>that</i>! And ten days from that day the boat had left the shore which
    never returned; never&mdash;and he <i>had</i> left me! gone! For three days we
    waited&mdash;and I hoped while I could&mdash;oh&mdash;that awful agony of three days!
    And the sun shone as it shines to-day, and there was no more wind than
    now; and the sea under the windows was like this paper for
    smoothness&mdash;and my sisters drew the curtains back that I might see for
    myself how smooth the sea was, and how it could hurt nobody&mdash;and other
    boats came back one by one.

    and you never wrote anything which <i>lived</i> with me more than <i>that</i>.
    It is such a dreadful truth. But you knew it for truth, I hope, by
    your genius, and not by such proof as mine&mdash;I, who could not speak or
    shed a tear, but lay for weeks and months half conscious, half
    unconscious, with a wandering mind, and too near to God under the
    crushing of His hand, to pray at all. I expiated all my weak tears
    before, by not being able to shed then one tear&mdash;and yet they were
    forbearing&mdash;and no voice said 'You have done this.'
</p>
<p>
    Do not notice what I have written to you, my dearest friend. I have
    never said so much to a living being&mdash;I never <i>could</i> speak or write
    of it. I asked no question from the moment when my last hope went: and
    since then, it has been impossible for me to speak what was in me. I
    have borne to do it to-day and to you, but perhaps if you were to
    write&mdash;so do not let this be noticed between us again&mdash;<i>do not</i>! And
    besides there is no need! I do not reproach myself with such acrid
    thoughts as I had once&mdash;I <i>know</i> that I would have died ten times over
    for <i>him</i>, and that therefore though it was wrong of me to be weak,
    and I have suffered for it and shall learn by it I hope; <i>remorse</i> is
    not precisely the word for me&mdash;not at least in its full sense. Still
    you will comprehend from what I have told you how the spring of life
    must have seemed to break within me <i>then</i>; and how natural it has
    been for me to loathe the living on&mdash;and to lose faith (even without
    the loathing), to lose faith in myself ... which I have done on some
    points utterly. It is not from the cause of illness&mdash;no. And you will
    comprehend too that I have strong reasons for being grateful to the
    forbearance.... It would have been <i>cruel</i>, you think, to reproach me.
    Perhaps so! yet the kindness and patience of the desisting from
    reproach, are positive things all the same.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I be too late for the post, I wonder? Wilson tells me that you
    were followed up-stairs yesterday (I write on Saturday this latter
    part) by somebody whom you probably took for my father. Which is
    Wilson's idea&mdash;and I hope not yours. No&mdash;it was neither father nor
    other relative of mine, but an old friend in rather an ill temper.
</p>
<p>
    And so good-bye until Tuesday. Perhaps I shall ... not ... hear from
    you to-night. Don't let the tragedy or aught else do you harm&mdash;will
    you? and try not to be 'weary in your soul' any more&mdash;and forgive me
    this gloomy letter I half shrink from sending you, yet will send.

    On the subject of your letter&mdash;quite irrespective of the injunction in

    myself, perhaps, to say I am <i>most</i> grateful, <i>most grateful</i>, dearest

    feelings. There is a better thing than being happy in your happiness;
    I feel, now that you teach me, it is so. I will write no more now;
    though that sentence of 'what you are <i>expecting</i>,&mdash;that I shall be
    tired of you &amp;c.,'&mdash;though I <i>could</i> blot that out of your mind for
    ever by a very few words <i>now</i>,&mdash;for you <i>would believe</i> me at this
    moment, close on the other subject:&mdash;but I will take no such
    advantage&mdash;I will wait.
</p>
<p>
    I have many things (indifferent things, after those) to say; will you
    write, if but a few lines, to change the associations for that

    But your 'Saul' is unobjectionable as far as I can see, my dear
    friend. He was tormented by an evil spirit&mdash;but how, we are not told
    ... and the consolation is not obliged to be definite, ... is it? A
    singer was sent for as a singer&mdash;and all that you are called upon to
    be true to, are the general characteristics of David the chosen,
    standing between his sheep and his dawning hereafter, between
    innocence and holiness, and with what you speak of as the 'gracious
    gold locks' besides the chrism of the prophet, on his own head&mdash;and
    surely you have been happy in the tone and spirit of these lyrics ...
    broken as you have left them. Where is the wrong in all this? For the
    right and beauty, they are more obvious&mdash;and I cannot tell you how the
    poem holds me and will not let me go until it blesses me ... and so,
    where are the 'sixty lines' thrown away? I do beseech you ... you who
    forget nothing, ... to remember them directly, and to go on with the
    rest ... <i>as</i> directly (be it understood) as is not injurious to your
    health. The whole conception of the poem, I like ... and the execution
    is exquisite up to this point&mdash;and the sight of Saul in the tent, just
    struck out of the dark by that sunbeam, 'a thing to see,' ... not to
    say that afterwards when he is visibly 'caught in his fangs' like the
    king serpent, ... the sight is grander still. How could you doubt
    about this poem....
</p>
<p>
    At the moment of writing which, I receive your note. Do <i>you</i> receive
    my assurances from the deepest of my heart that I never did otherwise
    than <i>'believe' you</i> ... never did nor shall do ... and that you
    completely misinterpreted my words if you drew another meaning from
    them. Believe <i>me</i> in this&mdash;will you? I could not believe <i>you</i> any
    more for anything you could say, now or hereafter&mdash;and so do not
    avenge yourself on my unwary sentences by remembering them against me
    for evil. I did not mean to vex you ... still less to suspect
    you&mdash;indeed I did not! and moreover it was quite your fault that I did
    not blot it out after it was written, whatever the meaning was. So you
    forgive me (altogether) for your own sins: you must:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    For my part, though I have been sorry since to have written you such a
    gloomy letter, the sorrow unmakes itself in hearing you speak so
    kindly. Your sympathy is precious to me, I may say. May God bless you.
    Write and tell me among the 'indifferent things' something not
    indifferent, how you are yourself, I mean ... for I fear you are not
    well and thought you were not looking so yesterday.

    I do not hear; and come to you to ask the alms of just one line,
    having taken it into my head that something is the matter. It is not
    so much exactingness on my part, as that you spoke of meaning to write
    as soon as you received a note of mine ... which went to you five
    minutes afterwards ... which is three days ago, or will be when you
    read this. Are you not well&mdash;or what? Though I have tried and <i>wished</i>
    to remember having written in the last note something very or even a
    little offensive to you, I failed in it and go back to the worse fear.
    For you could not be vexed with me for talking of what was 'your
    fault' ... 'your own fault,' viz. in having to read sentences which,
    but for your commands, would have been blotted out. You could not very
    well take <i>that</i> for serious blame! from <i>me</i> too, who have so much
    reason and provocation for blaming the archangel Gabriel.&mdash;No&mdash;you
    could not misinterpret so,&mdash;and if you could not, and if you are not
    displeased with me, you must be unwell, I think. I took for granted
    yesterday that you had gone out as before&mdash;but to-night it is
    different&mdash;and so I come to ask you to be kind enough to write one
    word for me by some post to-morrow. Now remember ... I am not asking

<p>
    Can you understand me <i>so</i>, dearest friend, after all? Do you see
    me&mdash;when I am away, or with you&mdash;'taking offence' at words, 'being
    vexed' at words, or deeds of yours, even if I could not immediately
    trace them to their source of entire, pure kindness; as I have
    hitherto done in every smallest instance?
</p>
<p>
    I believe in <i>you</i> absolutely, utterly&mdash;I believe that when you bade
    me, that time, be silent&mdash;that such was your bidding, and I was
    silent&mdash;dare I say I think you did not know at that time the power I
    have over myself, that I could sit and speak and listen as I have done
    since? Let me say now&mdash;<i>this only once</i>&mdash;that I loved you from my
    soul, and gave you my life, so much of it as you would take,&mdash;and all
    that is <i>done</i>, not to be altered now: it was, in the nature of the
    proceeding, wholly independent of any return on your part. I will not
    think on extremes you might have resorted to; as it is, the assurance
    of your friendship, the intimacy to which you admit me, <i>now</i>, make
    the truest, deepest joy of my life&mdash;a joy I can never think fugitive
    while we are in life, because I <SPAN class="sc-ex">know</span>, as to me, I <i>could</i> not
    willingly displease you,&mdash;while, as to you, your goodness and
    understanding will always see to the bottom of involuntary or ignorant
    faults&mdash;always help me to correct them. I have done now. If I thought
    you were like other women I have known, I should say so
    much!&mdash;but&mdash;(my first and last word&mdash;I <i>believe</i> in you!)&mdash;what you
    could and would give me, of your affection, you would give nobly and
    simply and as a giver&mdash;you would not need that I tell you&mdash;(<i>tell</i>
    you!)&mdash;what would be supreme happiness to me in the event&mdash;however
    distant&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I repeat ... I call on your justice to remember, on your intelligence
    to believe ... that this is merely a more precise stating the <i>first</i>
    subject; to put an end to any possible misunderstanding&mdash;to prevent
    your henceforth believing that because I <i>do not write</i>, from thinking
    too deeply of you, I am offended, vexed &amp;c. &amp;c. I will never recur to
    this, nor shall you see the least difference in my manner next Monday:
    it is indeed, always before me ... how I know nothing of you and
    yours. But I think I ought to have spoken when I did&mdash;and to speak
    clearly ... or more clearly what I do, as it is my pride and duty to
    fall back, now, on the feeling with which I have been in the
    meantime&mdash;Yours&mdash;God bless you&mdash;

    Let me write a few words to lead into Monday&mdash;and say, you have

    which is all, and fast going this morning. Of yours you say nothing&mdash;I
    trust you see your ... dare I say your <i>duty</i> in the Pisa affair, as

    I did not think you were angry&mdash;I never said so. But you might
    reasonably have been wounded a little, if you had suspected me of
    blaming you for any bearing of yours towards myself; and this was the
    amount of my fear&mdash;or rather hope ... since I conjectured most that
    you were not well. And after all you did think ... do think ... that
    in some way or for some moment I blamed you, disbelieved you,
    distrusted you&mdash;or why this letter? How have I provoked this letter?
    Can I forgive myself for having even seemed to have provoked it? and
    will you believe me that if for the past's sake you sent it, it was
    unnecessary, and if for the future's, irrelevant? Which I say from no
    want of sensibility to the words of it&mdash;your words always make
    themselves felt&mdash;but in fulness of purpose not to suffer you to hold
    to words because they have been said, nor to say them as if to be
    holden by them. Why, if a thousand more such words were said by you to
    me, how could they operate upon the future or present, supposing me to
    choose to keep the possible modification of your feelings, as a
    probability, in my sight and yours? Can you help my sitting with the
    doors all open if I think it right? I do attest to you&mdash;while I trust
    you, as you must see, in word and act, and while I am confident that
    no human being ever stood higher or purer in the eyes of another, than
    you do in mine,&mdash;that you would still stand high and remain
    unalterably my friend, if the probability in question became a fact,
    as now at this moment. And this I must say, since you have said other
    things: and this alone, which <i>I</i> have said, concerns the future, I
    remind you earnestly.
</p>
<p>
    My dearest friend&mdash;you have followed the most <i>generous</i> of impulses
    in your whole bearing to me&mdash;and I have recognised and called by its
    name, in my heart, each one of them. Yet I cannot help adding that, of
    us two, yours has not been quite the hardest part ... I mean, to a
    generous nature like your own, to which every sort of nobleness comes
    easily. Mine has been more difficult&mdash;and I have sunk under it again
    and again: and the sinking and the effort to recover the duty of a
    lost position, may have given me an appearance of vacillation and
    lightness, unworthy at least of <i>you</i>, and perhaps of both of us.
    Notwithstanding which appearance, it was right and just (only just) of
    you, to believe in me&mdash;in my truth&mdash;because I have never failed to you
    in it, nor been capable of <i>such</i> failure: the thing I have said, I
    have meant ... always: and in things I have not said, the silence has
    had a reason somewhere different perhaps from where you looked for it.
    And this brings me to complaining that you, who profess to believe in
    me, do yet obviously believe that it was only merely silence, which I
    required of you on one occasion&mdash;and that if I had 'known your power
    over yourself,' I should not have minded ... no! In other words you
    believe of me that I was thinking just of my own (what shall I call it
    for a motive base and small enough?) my own scrupulousness ... freedom
    from embarrassment! of myself in the least of me; in the tying of my
    shoestrings, say!&mdash;so much and no more! Now this is so wrong, as to
    make me impatient sometimes in feeling it to be your impression: I
    asked for silence&mdash;but <i>also</i> and chiefly for the putting away of ...
    you know very well what I asked for. And this was sincerely done, I
    attest to you. You wrote once to me ... oh, long before May and the
    day we met: that you 'had been so happy, you should be now justified
    to yourself in taking any step most hazardous to the happiness of your
    life'&mdash;but if you were justified, could <i>I</i> be therefore justified in
    abetting such a step,&mdash;the step of wasting, in a sense, your best
    feelings ... of emptying your water gourds into the sand? What I
    thought then I think now&mdash;just what any third person, knowing you,
    would think, I think and feel. I thought too, at first, that the
    feeling on your part was a mere generous impulse, likely to expand
    itself in a week perhaps. It affects me and has affected me, very
    deeply, more than I dare attempt to say, that you should persist
    <i>so</i>&mdash;and if sometimes I have felt, by a sort of instinct, that after
    all you would not go on to persist, and that (being a man, you know)
    you might mistake, a little unconsciously, the strength of your own
    feeling; you ought not to be surprised; when I felt it was more
    advantageous and happier for you that it should be so. <i>In any case</i>,
    I shall never regret my own share in the events of this summer, and
    your friendship will be dear to me to the last. You know I told you
    so&mdash;not long since. And as to what you say otherwise, you are right in
    thinking that I would not hold by unworthy motives in avoiding to
    speak what you had any claim to hear. But what could I speak that
    would not be unjust to you? Your life! if you gave it to me and I put
    my whole heart into it; what should I put but anxiety, and more
    sadness than you were born to? What could I give you, which it would
    not be ungenerous to give? Therefore we must leave this subject&mdash;and I
    must trust you to leave it without one word more; (too many have been
    said already&mdash;but I could not let your letter pass quite silently ...
    as if I had nothing to do but to receive all as matter of course
    <i>so</i>!) while you may well trust <i>me</i> to remember to my life's end, as
    the grateful remember; and to feel, as those do who have felt sorrow
    (for where these pits are dug, the water will stand), the full price
    of your regard. May God bless you, my dearest friend. I shall send
    this letter after I have seen you, and hope you may not have expected
    to hear sooner.

<p>
    Indeed my headaches are not worth enquiring about&mdash;I mean, they are
    not of the slightest consequence, and seldom survive the remedy of a
    cup of coffee. I only wish it were the same with everybody&mdash;I mean,
    with every <i>head</i>! Also there is nothing the matter otherwise&mdash;and I
    am going to prove my right to a 'clean bill of health' by going into
    the park in ten minutes. Twice round the inner enclosure is what I can
    compass now&mdash;which is equal to once round the world&mdash;is it not?
</p>
<p>
    I had just time to be afraid that the parcel had not reached you. The
    reason why I sent you the poems was that I had a few copies to give to
    my personal friends, and so, wished you to have one; and it was quite
    to please myself and not to please <i>you</i> that I made you have it; and
    if you put it into the 'plum-tree' to hide the errata, I shall be
    pleased still, if not rather more. Only let me remember to tell you
    this time in relation to those books and the question asked of
    yourself by your noble Romans, that just as I was enclosing my
    sixty-pounds debt to Mr. Moxon, I did actually and miraculously
    receive a remittance of fourteen pounds from the selfsame bookseller
    of New York who agreed last year to print my poems at his own risk and
    give me 'ten per cent on the profit.' Not that I ever asked for such a
    thing! They were the terms offered. And I always considered the 'per
    centage' as quite visionary ... put in for the sake of effect, to make
    the agreement look better! But no&mdash;you see! One's poetry has a real
    'commercial value,' if you do but take it far away enough from the
    'civilization of Europe.' When you get near the backwoods and the red
    Indians, it turns out to be nearly as good for something as
    'cabbages,' after all! Do you remember what you said to me of cabbages
    <i>versus</i> poems, in one of the first letters you ever wrote to me?&mdash;of
    selling cabbages and buying <i>Punches</i>?
</p>
<p>
    People complain of Dr. Chambers and call him rough and
    unfeeling&mdash;neither of which <i>I</i> ever found him for a moment&mdash;and I
    like him for his truthfulness, which is the nature of the man, though
    it is essential to medical morality never to let a patient think
    himself mortal while it is possible to prevent it, and even Dr.
    Chambers may incline to this on occasion. Still he need not have said
    all the good he said to me on Saturday&mdash;he <i>used</i> not to say any of
    it; and he must have thought some of it: and, any way, the Pisa-case
    is strengthened all round by his opinion and injunction, so that all
    my horror and terror at the thoughts of his visit, (and it's really
    true that I would rather <i>suffer</i> to a certain extent than be <i>cured</i>
    by means of those doctors!) had some compensation. How are you? do not
    forget to say! I found among some papers to-day, a note of yours which
    I asked Mr. Kenyon to give me for an autograph, two years ago.

    What you tell me of Dr. Chambers, 'all the good of you' he said, and
    all I venture to infer; this makes me most happy and thankful. Do you
    use to attach our old <span title="tuphlas elpidas">&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;

&epsilon;&lambda;&pi;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span> (and the practice of
    instilling them) to that medical science in which Prometheus boasted
    himself proficient? I had thought the 'faculty' dealt in fears, on the
    contrary, and scared you into obedience: but I know most about the
    doctors in Molière. However the joyous truth is&mdash;must be, that you are
    better, and if one could transport you quietly to Pisa, save you all
    worry,&mdash;what might one not expect!

<p>
    When I know your own intentions&mdash;measures, I should say, respecting

</p>
<p>
    I can thank you now for this edition of your poems&mdash;I have not yet
    taken to read it, though&mdash;for it does not, each volume of it, open
    obediently to a thought, here, and here, and here, like my green books
    ... no, my Sister's they are; so these you give me are really mine.
    And America, with its ten per cent., shall have my better word
    henceforth and for ever ... for when you calculate, there must have
    been a really extraordinary circulation; and in a few months: it is
    what newspapers call 'a great fact.' Have they reprinted the
    'Seraphim'? Quietly, perhaps!

    I am in the greatest difficulty about the steamers. Will you think a
    little for me and tell me what is best to do? It appears that the
    direct Leghorn steamer will not sail on the third, and may not until
    the middle of October, and if forced to still further delay, which is
    possible, will not at all. One of my brothers has been to Mr. Andrews
    of St. Mary Axe and heard as much as this. What shall I do? The middle
    of October, say my sisters ... and I half fear that it may prove so
    ... is too late for me&mdash;to say nothing for the uncertainty which
    completes the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
    On the 20th of September (on the other hand) sails the Malta vessel;
    and I hear that I may go in it to Gibraltar and find a French steamer
    there to proceed by. Is there an objection to this&mdash;except the change
    of steamers ... repeated ... for I must get down to Southampton&mdash;and
    the leaving England so soon? Is any better to be done? Do think for me
    a little. And now that the doing comes so near ... and in this dead
    silence of Papa's ... it all seems impossible, ... and I seem to see
    the stars <i>constellating</i> against me, and give it as my serious
    opinion to you that I shall not go. Now, mark.
</p>
<p>
    But I have had the kindest of letters from dear Mr. Kenyon, urging
    it&mdash;.
</p>
<p>
    Well&mdash;I have no time for writing any more&mdash;and this is only a note of
    business to bespeak your thoughts about the steamers. My wisdom looks
    back regretfully ... only rather too late ... on the Leghorn vessel
    of the third of September. It would have been wise if I had gone
    <i>then</i>.

    But if your head turns still, ... <i>do</i> you walk enough? Is there not

    One reason against printing the tragedies now, is your not being well
    enough for the necessary work connected with them, ... a sure reason
    and strong ... nay, chiefest of all. Plainly you are unfit for work
    now&mdash;and even to complete the preparation of the lyrics, and take them
    through the press, may be too much for you, I am afraid; and if so,
    why you will not do it&mdash;will you?&mdash;you will wait for another year,&mdash;or
    at least be satisfied for this, with bringing out a number of the old
    size, consisting of such poems as are fairly finished and require no
    retouching. 'Saul' for instance, you might leave&mdash;! You will not let
    me hear when I am gone, of your being ill&mdash;you will take care ... will
    you not? Because you see ... or rather <i>I</i> see ... you are <i>not</i>
    looking well at all&mdash;no, you are not! and even if you do not care for
    that, you should and must care to consider how unavailing it will be
    for you to hold those golden keys of the future with a more resolute
    hand than your contemporaries, should you suffer yourself to be struck
    down before the gate ... should you lose the physical power while
    keeping the heart and will. Heart and will are great things, and
    sufficient things in your case&mdash;but after all we carry a barrow-full
    of clay about with us, and we must carry it a little carefully if we
    mean to keep to the path and not run zigzag into the border of the
    garden. A figure which reminds me ... and I wanted no figure to remind
    me ... to ask you to thank your sister for me and from me for all her
    kindness about the flowers. Now you will not forget? you must not.
    When I think of the repeated trouble she has taken week after week,
    and all for a stranger, I must think again that it has been very
    kind&mdash;and I take the liberty of saying so moreover ... <i>as I am not
    thanking you</i>. Also these flowers of yesterday, which yesterday you
    disdained so, look full of summer and are full of fragrance, and when
    they seem to say that it is not September, I am willing to be lied to
    just <i>so</i>. For I wish it were not September. I wish it were July ...
    or November ... two months before or after: and that this journey were
    thrown behind or in front ... anywhere to be out of sight. You do not
    know the courage it requires to hold the intention of it fast through
    what I feel sometimes. If it (the courage) had been prophesied to me
    only a year ago, the prophet would have been laughed to scorn.
    Well!&mdash;but I want you to see. George's letter, and how he and Mrs.
    Hedley, when she saw Papa's note of consent to me, give unhesitating
    counsel. Burn it when you have read it. It is addressed to me ...
    which you will doubt from the address of it perhaps ... seeing that it
    goes <span title="ba ... rbarizôn">&beta;&alpha; ... &rho;&beta;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&zeta;&omega;&nu;</span>. We are famous in this house for what
    are called nick-names ... though a few of us have escaped rather by a
    caprice than a reason: and I am never called anything else (never at
    all) except by the nom de <i>paix</i> which you find written in the
    letter:&mdash;proving as Mr. Kenyon says, that I am just 'half a Ba-by' ...
    no more nor less;&mdash;and in fact the name has that precise definition.
    Burn the note when you have read it.
</p>
<p>
    And then I take it into my head, as you do not distinguish my sisters,
    you say, one from the other, to send you my own account of them in
    these enclosed 'sonnets' which were written a few weeks ago, and
    though only pretending to be 'sketches,' pretend to be like, as far as
    they go, and <i>are</i> like&mdash;my brothers thought&mdash;when I 'showed them
    against' a profile drawn in pencil by Alfred, on the same subjects. I
    was laughing and maintaining that mine should be as like as his&mdash;and
    he yielded the point to me. So it is mere portrait-painting&mdash;and you
    who are in 'high art,' must not be too scornful. Henrietta is the
    elder, and the one who brought you into this room first&mdash;and Arabel,
    who means to go with me to Pisa, has been the most with me through my
    illness and is the least wanted in the house here, ... and perhaps ...
    perhaps&mdash;is my favourite&mdash;though my heart smites me while I write that
    unlawful word. They are both affectionate and kind to me in all
    things, and good and lovable in their own beings&mdash;very unlike, for the
    rest; one, most caring for the Polka, ... and the other for the sermon
    preached at Paddington Chapel, ... <i>that</i> is Arabel ... so if ever you
    happen to know her you must try not to say before her how 'much you
    hate &amp;c.' Henrietta always 'managed' everything in the house even
    before I was ill, ... because she liked it and I didn't, and I waived
    my right to the sceptre of dinner-ordering.
</p>
<p>
    I have been thinking much of your 'Sordello' since you spoke of
    it&mdash;and even, I <i>had</i> thought much of it before you spoke of it
    yesterday; feeling that it might be thrown out into the light by your
    hand, and greatly justify the additional effort. It is like a noble
    picture with its face to the wall just now&mdash;or at least, in the
    shadow. And so worthy as it is of you in all ways! individual all
    through: you have <i>made</i> even the darkness of it! And such a work as
    it might become if you chose ... if you put your will to it! What I
    meant to say yesterday was not that it wanted more additional verses
    than the 'ten per cent' you spoke of ... though it does perhaps ... so
    much as that (to my mind) it wants drawing together and fortifying in
    the connections and associations ... which hang as loosely every here
    and there, as those in a dream, and confound the reader who persists
    in thinking himself awake.
</p>
<p>
    How do you mean that I am 'lenient'? Do you not believe that I tell
    you what I think, and as I think it? I may <i>think wrong</i>, to be
    sure&mdash;but <i>that</i> is not my fault:&mdash;and so there is no use reproaching
    me generally, unless you can convict me definitely at the same
    time:&mdash;is there, now?
</p>
<p>
    And I have been reading and admiring these letters of Mr. Carlyle, and
    receiving the greatest pleasure from them in every way. He is greatly
    <i>himself always</i>&mdash;which is the hardest thing for a man to be, perhaps.
    And what his appreciation of you is, it is easy to see&mdash;and what he
    expects from you&mdash;notwithstanding that prodigious advice of his, to
    write your next work in prose! Also Mrs. Carlyle's letter&mdash;thank you
    for letting me see it. I admire <i>that</i> too! It is as ingenious 'a
    case' against poor Keats, as could well be drawn&mdash;but nobody who knew
    very deeply what poetry <i>is</i>, <i>could</i>, you know, draw any case against
    him. A poet of the senses, he may be and is, just as she says&mdash;but
    then it is of the senses idealized; and no dream in a 'store-room'
    would ever be like the 'Eve of St. Agnes,' unless dreamed by some
    'animosus infans,' like Keats himself. Still it is all true ... isn't
    it?... what she observes of the want of thought as thought. He was a
    <i>seer</i> strictly speaking. And what noble oppositions&mdash;(to go back to
    Carlyle's letters) ... he writes to the things you were speaking of
    yesterday! These letters are as good as Milton's picture for
    convicting and putting to shame. Is not the difference between the men
    of our day and 'the giants which were on the earth,' less ... far less
    ... in the faculty ... in the gift, ... or in the general intellect,
    ... than in the stature of the soul itself? Our inferiority is not in
    what we can do, but in what we are. We should write poems like Milton
    if [we] lived them like Milton.
</p>
<p>
    I write all this just to show, I suppose, that I am not industrious as
    you did me the honour of apprehending that I was going to be ...
    packing trunks perhaps ... or what else in the way of 'active
    usefulness.'
</p>
<p>
    Say how you are&mdash;will you? And do take care, and walk and do what is
    good for you. I shall be able to see you twice before I go. And oh,
    this going! Pray for me, dearest friend. May God bless you.

    Here are your beautiful, and I am sure <i>true</i> sonnets; they look
    true&mdash;I remember the light hair, I find. And who paints, and dares
    exhibit, E.B.B.'s self? And surely 'Alfred's' pencil has not foregone
    its best privilege, not left <i>the</i> face unsketched? Italians call such
    an 'effect defective'&mdash;'l'andar a Roma senza vedere il Papa.' He must
    have begun by seeing his Holiness, I know, and ... <i>he</i> will not trust
    me with the result, that my sister may copy it for me, because we are
    strangers, he and I, and I could give him nothing, nothing like the
    proper price for it&mdash;but <i>you</i> would lend it to me, I think, nor need
    I do more than thank you in my usual effective and very eloquent
    way&mdash;for I have already been allowed to visit you seventeen times, do
    you know; and this last letter of yours, fiftieth is the same! So all
    my pride is gone, pride in that sense&mdash;and I mean to take of you for
    ever, and reconcile myself with my lot in this life. Could, and would,
    you give me such a sketch? It has been on my mind to ask you ever
    since I knew you if nothing in the way of <i>good</i> portrait existed&mdash;and
    this occasion bids me speak out, I dare believe: the more, that you
    have also quieted&mdash;have you not?&mdash;another old obstinate and very
    likely impertinent questioning of mine&mdash;as to the little name which
    was neither Orinda, nor Sacharissa (for which thank providence) and is
    never to appear in books, though you write them. Now I know it and
    write it&mdash;'Ba'&mdash;and thank you, and your brother George, and only
    burned his kind letter because you bade me who know best. So, wish by
    wish, one gets one's wishes&mdash;at least I do&mdash;for one instance, you will

    Why, 'lean and harken after it' as Donne says&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Don't expect Neapolitan Scenery at Pisa, quite in the North, remember.
    Mrs. Shelley found Italy for the first time, real Italy, at Sorrento,
    she says. Oh that book&mdash;does one wake or sleep? The 'Mary dear' with
    the brown eyes, and Godwin's daughter and Shelley's wife, and who
    surely was something better once upon a time&mdash;and to go through Rome
    and Florence and the rest, after what I suppose to be Lady
    Londonderry's fashion: the intrepidity of the commonplace quite
    astounds me. And then that way, when she and the like of her are put
    in a new place, with new flowers, new stones, faces, walls, all
    new&mdash;of looking wisely up at the sun, clouds, evening star, or
    mountain top and wisely saying 'who shall describe <i>that</i> sight!'&mdash;Not
    <i>you</i>, we very well see&mdash;but why don't you tell us that at Rome they
    eat roasted chestnuts, and put the shells into their aprons, the women
    do, and calmly empty the whole on the heads of the passengers in the
    street below; and that at Padua when a man drives his waggon up to a
    house and stops, all the mouse-coloured oxen that pull it from a beam
    against their foreheads sit down in a heap and rest. But once she
    travelled the country with Shelley on arm; now she plods it, Rogers in
    hand&mdash;to such things and uses may we come at last! Her remarks on art,
    once she lets go of Rio's skirts, are amazing&mdash;Fra Angelico, for
    instance, only painted Martyrs, Virgins &amp;c., she had no eyes for the
    divine <i>bon-bourgeoisie</i> of his pictures; the dear common folk of his
    crowds, those who sit and listen (spectacle at nose and bent into a
    comfortable heap to hear better) at the sermon of the Saint&mdash;and the
    children, and women,&mdash;divinely pure they all are, but fresh from the
    streets and market place&mdash;but she is wrong every where, that is, not
    right, not seeing what is to see, speaking what one expects to hear&mdash;I
    quarrel with her, for ever, I think.
</p>
<p>
    I am much better, and mean to be well as you desire&mdash;shall correct the
    verses you have seen, and make them do for the present.

<p>
    Now, dearest, I will try and write the little I shall be able, in
    reply to your letter of last week&mdash;and first of all I have to entreat
    you, now more than ever, to help me and understand from the few words
    the feelings behind them&mdash;(should <i>speak</i> rather more easily, I
    think&mdash;but I dare not run the risk: and I know, after all, you will be
    just and kind where you can.) I have read your letter again and
    again. I will tell you&mdash;no, not <i>you</i>, but any imaginary other person,
    who should hear what I am going to avow; I would tell that person most
    sincerely there is not a particle of fatuity, shall I call it, in that
    avowal; cannot be, seeing that from the beginning and at this moment I
    never dreamed of winning your <i>love</i>. I can hardly write this word, so
    incongruous and impossible does it seem; such a change of our places
    does it imply&mdash;nor, next to that, though long after, <i>would</i> I, if I
    <i>could</i>, supplant one of any of the affections that I know to have
    taken root in you&mdash;<i>that</i> great and solemn one, for instance. I feel
    that if I could get myself <i>remade</i>, as if turned to gold, I <SPAN class="sc-ex">would</span> not
    even then desire to become more than the mere setting to <i>that</i>
    diamond you must always wear. The regard and esteem you now give me,
    in this letter, and which I press to my heart and bow my head upon, is
    all I can take and all too embarrassing, using <i>all</i> my gratitude. And
    yet, with that contented pride in being infinitely your debtor as it
    is, bound to you for ever as it is; when I read your letter with all
    the determination to be just to us both; I dare not so far withstand
    the light I am master of, as to refuse seeing that whatever is
    recorded as an objection to your disposing of that life of mine I
    would give you, has reference to some supposed good in that life which
    your accepting it would destroy (of which fancy I shall speak
    presently)&mdash;I say, wonder as I may at this, I cannot but find it
    there, surely there. I could no more 'bind <i>you</i> by words,' than you
    have bound me, as you say&mdash;but if I misunderstand you, one assurance
    to that effect will be but too intelligible to me&mdash;but, as it <i>is</i>, I
    have difficulty in imagining that while one of so many reasons, which
    I am not obliged to repeat to myself, but which any one easily
    conceives; while <i>any one</i> of those reasons would impose silence on me
    <i>for ever</i> (for, as I observed, I love you as you now are, and <i>would</i>
    not remove one affection that is already part of you,)&mdash;<i>would</i> you,
    being able to speak <i>so</i>, only say <i>that you</i> desire not to put 'more
    sadness than I was born to,' into my life?&mdash;that you 'could give me
    only what it were ungenerous to give'?
</p>
<p>
    Have I your meaning here? In so many words, is it on my account that
    you bid me 'leave this subject'? I think if it were so, I would for
    once call my advantages round me. I am not what your generous
    self-forgetting appreciation would sometimes make me out&mdash;but it is
    not since yesterday, nor ten nor twenty years before, that I began to
    look into my own life, and study its end, and requirements, what would
    turn to its good or its loss&mdash;and I <i>know</i>, if one may know anything,
    that to make that life yours and increase it by union with yours,
    would render me <i>supremely happy</i>, as I said, and say, and feel. My
    whole suit to you is, in that sense, <i>selfish</i>&mdash;not that I am ignorant
    that <i>your</i> nature would most surely attain happiness in being
    conscious that it made another happy&mdash;but <i>that best, best end of
    all</i>, would, like the rest, come from yourself, be a reflection of
    your own gift.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, I will end here&mdash;words, persuasion, arguments, if they were
    at my service I would not use them&mdash;I believe in you, altogether have
    faith in you&mdash;in you. I will not think of insulting by trying to
    reassure you on one point which certain phrases in your letter might
    at first glance seem to imply&mdash;you do not understand me to be living
    and labouring and writing (and <i>not</i> writing) in order to be
    successful in the world's sense? I even convinced the people <i>here</i>
    what was my true 'honourable position in society,' &amp;c. &amp;c. therefore I
    shall not have to inform <i>you</i> that I desire to be very rich, very
    great; but not in reading Law gratis with dear foolish old Basil
    Montagu, as he ever and anon bothers me to do;&mdash;much less&mdash;enough of
    this nonsense.
</p>
<p>
    'Tell me what I have a claim to hear': I can hear it, and be as
    grateful as I was before and am now&mdash;your friendship is my pride and
    happiness. If you told me your love was bestowed elsewhere, and that
    it was in my power to serve you <i>there</i>, to serve you there would
    still be my pride and happiness. I look on and on over the prospect of
    my love, it is all <i>on</i>wards&mdash;and all possible forms of unkindness ...
    I quite laugh to think how they are <i>behind</i> ... cannot be encountered
    in the route we are travelling! I submit to you and will obey you
    implicitly&mdash;obey what I am able to conceive of your least desire, much
    more of your expressed wish. But it was necessary to make this avowal,
    among other reasons, for one which the world would recognize too. My
    whole scheme of life (with its wants, material wants at least, closely
    cut down) was long ago calculated&mdash;and it supposed <i>you</i>, the finding
    such an one as you, utterly impossible&mdash;because in calculating one
    goes upon <i>chances</i>, not on providence&mdash;how could I expect you? So for
    my own future way in the world I have always refused to care&mdash;any one
    who can live a couple of years and more on bread and potatoes as I did
    once on a time, and who prefers a blouse and a blue shirt (such as I
    now write in) to all manner of dress and gentlemanly appointment, and
    who can, if necessary, groom a horse not so badly, or at all events
    would rather do it all day long than succeed Mr. Fitzroy Kelly in the
    Solicitor-Generalship,&mdash;such an one need not very much concern himself
    beyond considering the lilies how they grow. But now I see you near
    this life, all changes&mdash;and at a word, I will do all that ought to be
    done, that every one used to say could be done, and let 'all my powers
    find sweet employ' as Dr. Watts sings, in getting whatever is to be
    got&mdash;not very much, surely. I would print these things, get them away,
    and do this now, and go to you at Pisa with the news&mdash;at Pisa where
    one may live for some £100 a year&mdash;while, lo, I seem to remember, I
    <i>do</i> remember, that Charles Kean offered to give me 500 of those
    pounds for any play that might suit him&mdash;to say nothing of Mr. Colburn
    saying confidentially that he wanted more than his dinner 'a novel on
    the subject of <i>Napoleon</i>'! So may one make money, if one does not
    live in a house in a row, and feel impelled to take the Princess's
    Theatre for a laudable development and exhibition of one's faculty.
</p>
<p>
    Take the sense of all this, I beseech you, dearest&mdash;all you shall say
    will be best&mdash;I am yours&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Yes, Yours ever. God bless you for all you have been, and are, and
    will certainly be to me, come what He shall please!

<i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>

<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, September 16, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I scarcely know how to write what is to be written nor indeed why it
    is to be written and to what end. I have tried in vain&mdash;and you are
    waiting to hear from me. I am unhappy enough even where I am
    happy&mdash;but ungrateful nowhere&mdash;and I thank you from my
    heart&mdash;profoundly from the depths of my heart ... which is nearly all
    I can do.
</p>
<p>
    One letter I began to write and asked in it how it could become me to
    speak at all if '<i>from the beginning and at this moment you never
    dreamed of</i>' ... and there, I stopped and tore the paper; because I
    felt that you were too loyal and generous, for me to bear to take a
    moment's advantage of the same, and bend down the very flowering
    branch of your generosity (as it might be) to thicken a little the
    fence of a woman's caution and reserve. You will not say that you have
    not acted as if you 'dreamed'&mdash;and I will answer therefore to the
    general sense of your letter and former letters, and admit at once
    that I <i>did</i> state to you the difficulties most difficult to myself
    ... though not all ... and that if I had been worthier of you I should
    have been proportionably less in haste to 'bid you leave that
    subject.' I do not understand how you can seem at the same moment to
    have faith in my integrity and to have doubt whether all this time I
    may not have felt a preference for another ... which you are ready
    'to serve,' you say. Which is generous in you&mdash;but in <i>me</i>, where were
    the integrity? Could you really hold me to be blameless, and do you
    think that truehearted women act usually so? Can it be necessary for
    me to tell you that I could not have acted so, and did not? And shall
    I shrink from telling you besides ... you, who have been generous to
    me and have a right to hear it ... and have spoken to me in the name
    of an affection and memory most precious and holy to me, in this same
    letter ... that neither now nor formerly has any man been to my
    feelings what you are ... and that if I were different in some
    respects and free in others by the providence of God, I would accept
    the great trust of your happiness, gladly, proudly, and gratefully;
    and give away my own life and soul to that end. I <i>would</i> do it ...
    <i>not, I do</i> ... observe! it is a truth without a consequence; only
    meaning that I am not all stone&mdash;only proving that I am not likely to
    consent to help you in wrong against yourself. You see in me what is
    not:&mdash;<i>that</i>, I know: and you overlook in me what is unsuitable to you
    ... <i>that</i> I know, and have sometimes told you. Still, because a
    strong feeling from some sources is self-vindicating and ennobling to
    the object of it, I will not say that, if it were proved to me that
    you felt this for me, I would persist in putting the sense of my own
    unworthiness between you and me&mdash;not being heroic, you know, nor
    pretending to be so. But something worse than even a sense of
    unworthiness, <i>God</i> has put between us! and judge yourself if to beat
    your thoughts against the immovable marble of it, can be anything but
    pain and vexation of spirit, waste and wear of spirit to you ...
    judge! The present is here to be seen ... speaking for itself! and the
    best future you can imagine for me, what a precarious thing it must be
    ... a thing for making burdens out of ... only not for your carrying,
    as I have vowed to my own soul. As dear Mr. Kenyon said to me to-day
    in his smiling kindness ... 'In ten years you may be strong
    perhaps'&mdash;or 'almost strong'! that being the encouragement of my best
    friends! What would he say, do you think, if he could know or
    guess...! what <i>could</i> he say but that you were ... a poet!&mdash;and I ...
    still worse! <i>Never</i> let him know or guess!
</p>
<p>
    And so if you are wise and would be happy (and you have excellent
    practical sense after all and should exercise it) you must leave
    me&mdash;these thoughts of me, I mean ... for if we might not be true
    friends for ever, I should have less courage to say the other truth.
    But we may be friends always ... and cannot be so separated, that your
    happiness, in the knowledge of it, will not increase mine. And if you
    will be persuaded by me, as you say, you will be persuaded <i>thus</i> ...
    and consent to take a resolution and force your mind at once into
    another channel. Perhaps I might bring you reasons of the class which
    you tell me 'would silence you for ever.' I might certainly tell you
    that my own father, if he knew that you had written to me <i>so</i>, and
    that I had answered you&mdash;<i>so</i>, even, would not forgive me at the end
    of ten years&mdash;and this, from none of the causes mentioned by me here
    and in no disrespect to your name and your position ... though he does
    not over-value poetry even in his daughter, and is apt to take the
    world's measures of the means of life ... but for the singular reason
    that he never <i>does</i> tolerate in his family (sons or daughters) the
    development of one class of feelings. Such an objection I could not
    bring to you of my own will&mdash;it rang hollow in my ears&mdash;perhaps I
    thought even too little of it:&mdash;and I brought to you what I thought
    much of, and cannot cease to think much of equally. Worldly thoughts,
    these are not at all, nor have been: there need be no soiling of the
    heart with any such:&mdash;and I will say, in reply to some words of yours,
    that you cannot despise the gold and gauds of the world more than I
    do, and should do even if I found a use for them. And if I <i>wished</i> to
    be very poor, in the world's sense of poverty, I <i>could not</i>, with
    three or four hundred a year of which no living will can dispossess
    me. And is it not the chief good of money, the being free from the
    need of thinking of it? It seems so to me.
</p>
<p>
    The obstacles then are of another character, and the stronger for
    being so. Believe that I am grateful to you&mdash;<i>how</i> grateful, cannot be
    shown in words nor even in tears ... grateful enough to be truthful in
    all ways. You know I might have hidden myself from you&mdash;but I would
    not: and by the truth told of myself, you may believe in the
    earnestness with which I tell the other truths&mdash;of you ... and of this
    subject. The subject will not bear consideration&mdash;it breaks in our
    hands. But that God is stronger than we, cannot be a bitter thought to
    you but a holy thought ... while He lets me, as much as I can be
    anyone's, be only yours.

<p>
    I do not know whether you imagine the precise effect of your letter on
    me&mdash;very likely you do, and write it just for that&mdash;for I conceive
    <i>all</i> from your goodness. But before I tell you what is that effect,
    let me say in as few words as possible what shall stop any
    fear&mdash;though only for a moment and on the outset&mdash;that you have been
    misunderstood, that the goodness <i>outside</i>, and round and over all,
    hides all or any thing. I understand you to signify to me that you
    see, at this present, insurmountable obstacles to that&mdash;can I speak
    it&mdash;entire gift, which I shall own, was, while I dared ask it, above
    my hopes&mdash;and wishes, even, so it seems to me ... and yet could not
    but be asked, so plainly was it dictated to me, by something quite out
    of those hopes and wishes. Will it help me to say that once in this
    Aladdin-cavern I knew I ought to stop for no heaps of jewel-fruit on
    the trees from the very beginning, but go on to the lamp, <i>the</i> prize,
    the last and best of all? Well, I understand you to pronounce that at
    present you believe this gift impossible&mdash;and I acquiesce entirely&mdash;I
    submit wholly to you; repose on you in all the faith of which I am
    capable. Those obstacles are solely for <i>you</i> to see and to declare
    ... had <i>I</i> seen them, be sure I should never have mocked you or
    myself by affecting to pass them over ... what <i>were</i> obstacles, I
    mean: but you <i>do</i> see them, I must think,&mdash;and perhaps they strike me
    the more from my true, honest unfeigned inability to imagine what they
    are,&mdash;not that I shall endeavour. After what you <i>also</i> apprise me of,
    I know and am joyfully confident that if ever they cease to be what
    you now consider them, you who see now <i>for me</i>, whom I implicitly
    trust in to see for me; you will <i>then</i>, too, see and remember me, and
    how I trust, and shall then be still trusting. And until you so see,
    and so inform me, I shall never utter a word&mdash;for that would involve
    the vilest of implications. I thank God&mdash;I <i>do</i> thank him, that in
    this whole matter I have been, to the utmost of my power, not unworthy
    of his introducing you to me, in this respect that, being no longer in
    the first freshness of life, and having for many years now made up my
    mind to the impossibility of loving any woman ... having wondered at
    this in the beginning, and fought not a little against it, having
    acquiesced in it at last, and accounted for it all to myself, and
    become, if anything, rather proud of it than sorry ... I say, when
    real love, making itself at once recognized as such, <i>did</i> reveal
    itself to me at last, I <i>did</i> open my heart to it with a cry&mdash;nor care
    for its overturning all my theory&mdash;nor mistrust its effect upon a mind
    set in ultimate order, so I fancied, for the few years more&mdash;nor
    apprehend in the least that the new element would harm what was
    already organized without its help. Nor have I, either, been guilty of
    the more pardonable folly, of treating the new feeling after the
    pedantic fashions and instances of the world. I have not spoken when
    <i>it</i> did not speak, because 'one' might speak, or has spoken, or
    <i>should</i> speak, and 'plead' and all that miserable work which, after
    all, I may well continue proud that I am not called to attempt. <i>Here</i>
    for instance, <i>now</i> ... 'one' should despair; but 'try again' first,
    and work blindly at removing those obstacles (&mdash;if I saw them, I
    should be silent, and only speak when a month hence, ten years hence,
    I could bid you look where they <i>were</i>)&mdash;and 'one' would do all this,
    not for the <i>play-acting's</i> sake, or to 'look the character' ...
    (<i>that</i> would be something quite different from folly ...) but from a
    not unreasonable anxiety lest by too sudden a silence, too complete an
    acceptance of your will; the earnestness and endurance and
    unabatedness ... the <i>truth</i>, in fact, of what had already been
    professed, should get to be questioned&mdash;But I believe that you believe
    me&mdash;And now that all is clear between us I will say, what you will
    hear, without fearing for me or yourself, that I am utterly contented
    ... ('grateful' I have done with ... it must go&mdash;) I accept what you
    give me, what those words deliver to me, as&mdash;not all I asked for ...
    as I said ... but as more than I ever hoped for,&mdash;<i>all</i>, in the best
    sense, that I deserve. That phrase in my letter which you objected to,
    and the other&mdash;may stand, too&mdash;I never attempted to declare, describe
    my feeling for you&mdash;one word of course stood for it all ... but having
    to put down some one <i>point</i>, so to speak, of it&mdash;you could not wonder
    if I took any extreme one <i>first</i> ... never minding all the untold
    portion that <i>led</i> up to it, made it possible and natural&mdash;it is true,
    'I could not dream of <i>that</i>'&mdash;that I was eager to get the horrible
    notion away from never so flitting a visit to you, that you were thus
    and thus to me <i>on condition</i> of my proving just the same to you&mdash;just
    as if we had waited to acknowledge that the moon lighted us till we
    ascertained within these two or three hundred years that the earth
    happens to light the moon as well! But I felt that, and so said
    it:&mdash;now you have declared what I should never have presumed to
    hope&mdash;and I repeat to you that I, with all to be thankful for to God,
    am most of all thankful for this the last of his providences ... which
    is no doubt, the natural and inevitable feeling, could one always see
    clearly. Your regard for me is <i>all</i> success&mdash;let the rest come, or
    not come. In my heart's thankfulness I would ... I am sure I would
    promise anything that would gratify you ... but it would <i>not</i> do
    that, to agree, in words, to change my affections, put them elsewhere
    &amp;c. &amp;c. That would be pure foolish talking, and quite foreign to the
    practical results which you will attain in a better way from a higher
    motive. I will cheerfully promise you, however, to be 'bound by no
    words,' blind to no miracle; in sober earnest, it is not because I
    renounced once for all oxen and the owning and having to do with them,
    that I will obstinately turn away from any unicorn when such an
    apparition blesses me ... but meantime I shall walk at peace on our
    hills here nor go looking in all corners for the bright curved horn!
    And as for you ... if I did not dare 'to dream of that'&mdash;, now it is
    mine, my pride and joy prevent in no manner my taking the whole
    consolation of it at once, <i>now</i>&mdash;I will be confident that, if I obey
    you, I shall get no wrong for it&mdash;if, endeavouring to spare you
    fruitless pain, I do not eternally revert to the subject; do indeed
    'quit' it just now, when no good can come of dwelling on it to you;
    you will never say to yourself&mdash;so I said&mdash;'the "generous impulse"
    <i>has</i> worn itself out ... time is doing his usual work&mdash;this was to be
    expected' &amp;c. &amp;c. You will be the first to say to me 'such an obstacle
    has ceased to exist ... or is now become one palpable to <i>you</i>, one
    <i>you</i> may try and overcome'&mdash;and I shall be there, and ready&mdash;ten
    years hence as now&mdash;if alive.
</p>
<p>
    One final word on the other matters&mdash;the 'worldly matters'&mdash;I shall
    own I alluded to them rather ostentatiously, because&mdash;because <i>that
    would be</i> the <i>one</i> poor sacrifice I could make you&mdash;one I would
    cheerfully make, but a sacrifice, and the only one: this careless
    'sweet habitude of living'&mdash;this absolute independence of mine, which,
    if I had it not, my heart would starve and die for, I feel, and which
    I have fought so many good battles to preserve&mdash;for that has
    happened, too&mdash;this light rational life I lead, and know so well that
    I lead; this I could give up for nothing less than&mdash;what you know&mdash;but
    I <i>would</i> give it up, not for you merely, but for those whose
    disappointment might re-act on you&mdash;and I should break no promise to
    myself&mdash;the money getting would not be for the sake of <i>it</i>; 'the
    labour not for that which is nought'&mdash;indeed the necessity of doing
    this, if at all, <i>now</i>, was one of the reasons which make me go on to
    that <i>last request of all</i>&mdash;at once; one must not be too old, they
    say, to begin their ways. But, in spite of all the babble, I feel sure
    that whenever I make up my mind to that, I can be rich enough and to
    spare&mdash;because along with what you have thought <i>genius</i> in me, is
    certainly talent, what the world recognizes as such; and I have tried
    it in various ways, just to be sure that I <i>was</i> a little magnanimous
    in never intending to use it. Thus, in more than one of the reviews
    and newspapers that laughed my 'Paracelsus' to scorn ten years ago&mdash;in
    the same column, often, of these reviews, would follow a most
    laudatory notice of an Elementary French book, on a new plan, which I
    '<i>did</i>' for my old French master, and he published&mdash;'<i>that</i> was really
    an useful work'!&mdash;So that when the only obstacle is only that there is
    so much <i>per annum</i> to be producible, you will tell me. After all it
    would be unfair in me not to confess that this was always intended to
    be <i>my</i> own single stipulation&mdash;'an objection' which I could see,
    certainly,&mdash;but meant to treat myself to the little luxury of
    removing.
</p>
<p>
    So, now, dearest&mdash;let me once think of that, and of you as my own, my
    dearest&mdash;this once&mdash;dearest, I have done with words for the present. I
    will wait. God bless you and reward you&mdash;I kiss your hands <i>now</i>. This
    is my comfort, that if you accept my feeling as all but <i>un</i>expressed
    now, more and more will become spoken&mdash;or understood, that is&mdash;we both
    live on&mdash;you will know better <i>what</i> it was, how much and manifold,
    what one little word had to give out.

</p>
<p>
    I write one word just to say that it is all over with Pisa; which was
    a probable evil when I wrote last, and which I foresaw from the
    beginning&mdash;being a prophetess, you know. I cannot tell you now how it
    has all happened&mdash;<i>only do not blame me</i>, for I have kept my ground to
    the last, and only yield when Mr. Kenyon and all the world see that
    there is no standing. I am ashamed almost of having put so much
    earnestness into a personal matter&mdash;and I spoke face to face and quite
    firmly&mdash;so as to pass with my sisters for the 'bravest person in the
    house' without contestation.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes it seems to me as if it <i>could not</i> end so&mdash;I mean, that the
    responsibility of such a negative must be reconsidered ... and you see
    how Mr. Kenyon writes to me. Still, as the matter lies, ... no Pisa!
    And, as I said before, my prophetic instincts are not likely to fail,
    such as they have been from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to come, it must not be until Saturday at soonest. I have
    a headache and am weary at heart with all this vexation&mdash;and besides
    there is no haste now: and when you do come, <i>if you do</i>, I will trust
    to you not to recur to one subject, which must lie where it fell ...
    must! I had begun to write to you on Saturday, to say how I had
    forgotten to give you your MSS. which were lying ready for you ... the
    <i>Hood</i> poems. Would it not be desirable that you made haste to see
    them through the press, and went abroad with your Roman friends at
    once, to try to get rid of that uneasiness in the head? Do think of
    it&mdash;and more than think.
</p>
<p>
    For me, you are not to fancy me unwell. Only, not to be worn a little
    with the last week's turmoil, were impossible&mdash;and Mr. Kenyon said to
    me yesterday that he quite wondered how I could bear it at all, do
    anything reasonable at all, and confine my misdoings to sending
    letters addressed to him at Brighton, when he was at Dover! If
    anything changes, you shall hear from&mdash;
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.

    Mr. Kenyon returns to Dover immediately. His kindness is impotent in
    the case.

<p>
    But one word before we leave the subject, and then to leave it
    finally; but I cannot let you go on to fancy a mystery anywhere, in
    obstacles or the rest. You deserve at least a full frankness; and in
    my letter I meant to be fully frank. I even told you what was an
    absurdity, so absurd that I should far rather not have told you at
    all, only that I felt the need of telling you all: and no mystery is
    involved in that, except as an 'idiosyncrasy' is a mystery. But the
    'insurmountable' difficulty is for you and everybody to see; and for
    me to feel, who have been a very byword among the talkers, for a
    confirmed invalid through months and years, and who, even if I were
    going to Pisa and had the best prospects possible to me, should yet
    remain liable to relapses and stand on precarious ground to the end of
    my life. Now that is no mystery for the trying of 'faith'; but a plain
    fact, which neither thinking nor speaking can make less a fact. But
    <i>don't</i> let us speak of it.
</p>
<p>
    I must speak, however, (before the silence) of what you said and
    repeat in words for which I gratefully thank you&mdash;and which are <i>not</i>
    'ostentatious' though unnecessary words&mdash;for, if I were in a position
    to accept sacrifices from you, I would not accept <i>such</i> a sacrifice
    ... amounting to a sacrifice of duty and dignity as well as of ease
    and satisfaction ... to an exchange of higher work for lower work ...
    and of the special work you are called to, for that which is work for
    anybody. I am not so ignorant of the right uses and destinies of what
    you have and are. You will leave the Solicitor-Generalships to the
    Fitzroy Kellys, and justify your own nature; and besides, do me the
    little right, (<i>over</i> the <i>over</i>-right you are always doing me) of
    believing that I would not bear or dare to do <i>you</i> so much wrong, if
    I were in the position to do it.

    And for all the rest I thank you&mdash;believe that I thank you ... and
    that the feeling is not so weak as the word. That <i>you</i> should care at
    all for <i>me</i> has been a matter of unaffected wonder to me from the
    first hour until now&mdash;and I cannot help the pain I feel sometimes, in
    thinking that it would have been better for you if you never had known
    me. May God turn back the evil of me! Certainly I admit that I cannot
    expect you ... just at this moment, ... to say more than you say, ...
    and I shall try to be at ease in the consideration that you are as
    accessible to the 'unicorn' now as you ever could be at any former
    period of your life. And here I have done. I had done <i>living</i>, I
    thought, when you came and sought me out! and why? and to what end?
    <i>That</i>, I cannot help thinking now. Perhaps just that I may pray for
    you&mdash;which were a sufficient end. If you come on Saturday I trust you
    to leave this subject untouched,&mdash;as it must be indeed henceforth.

    Of course you cannot do otherwise than go with your sister&mdash;or it will
    be 'Every man <i>out</i> of his humour' perhaps&mdash;and you are not so very

<p>
    Papa has been walking to and fro in this room, looking thoughtfully
    and talking leisurely&mdash;and every moment I have expected I confess,
    some word (that did not come) about Pisa. Mr. Kenyon thinks it cannot
    end so&mdash;and I do sometimes&mdash;and in the meantime I do confess to a
    little 'savageness' also&mdash;at heart! All I asked him to say the other
    day, was that he was not displeased with me&mdash;<i>and he wouldn't</i>; and
    for me to walk across his displeasure spread on the threshold of the
    door, and moreover take a sister and brother with me, and do such a
    thing for the sake of going to Italy and securing a personal
    advantage, were altogether impossible, obviously impossible! So poor
    Papa is quite in disgrace with me just now&mdash;if he would but care for
    <i>that</i>!
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. Amuse yourself well on Saturday. I could not see
    you on Thursday any way, for Mr. Kenyon is here every day ... staying
    in town just on account of this Pisa business, in his abundant

    But you, too, will surely want, if you think me a rational creature,
    <i>my</i> explanation&mdash;without which all that I have said and done would be
    pure madness, I think. It <i>is</i> just 'what I see' that I <i>do</i> see,&mdash;or
    rather it has proved, since I first visited you, that the reality was
    infinitely worse than I know it to be ... for at, and after the
    writing of <i>that first letter</i>, on my first visit, I believed&mdash;through
    some silly or misapprehended talk, collected at second hand too&mdash;that
    your complaint was of quite another nature&mdash;a spinal injury
    irremediable in the nature of it. Had it been <i>so</i>&mdash;now speak for
    <i>me</i>, for what you hope I am, and say how <i>that</i> should affect or
    neutralize what you <i>were</i>, what I wished to associate with myself in
    you? But <i>as you now are</i>:&mdash;then if I had married you seven years ago,
    and this visitation came now first, I should be 'fulfilling a pious
    duty,' I suppose, in enduring what could not be amended&mdash;a pattern to
    good people in not running away ... for where were <i>now</i> the use and
    the good and the profit and&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I desire in this life (with very little fluctuation for a man and too
    weak a one) to live and just write out certain things which are in me,
    and so save my soul. I would endeavour to do this if I were forced to
    'live among lions' as you once said&mdash;but I should best do this if I
    lived quietly with myself and with you. That you cannot dance like
    Cerito does not materially disarrange this plan&mdash;nor that I might
    (beside the perpetual incentive and sustainment and consolation) get,
    over and above the main reward, the incidental, particular and
    unexpected happiness of being allowed when not working to rather
    occupy myself with watching you, than with certain other pursuits I
    might be otherwise addicted to&mdash;<i>this</i>, also, does not constitute an
    obstacle, as I see obstacles.
</p>
<p>
    But <i>you</i> see them&mdash;and I see <i>you</i>, and know my first duty and do it
    resolutely if not cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
    As for referring again, till leave by word or letter&mdash;you will see&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And very likely, the tone of this letter even will be
    misunderstood&mdash;because I studiously cut out all vain words, protesting
    &amp;c.:&mdash;No&mdash;will it?
</p>
<p>
    I said, unadvisedly, that Saturday was taken from me ... but it was
    dark and I had not looked at the tickets: the hour of the performance
    is later than I thought. If to-morrow does not suit you, as I infer,
    let it be Saturday&mdash;at 3&mdash;and I will leave earlier, a little, and all

    It is not 'misunderstanding' you to know you to be the most generous

    I began to write last Saturday to thank you for all the delight I had

    are few. Besides the translations, some of the original poems were not

    I have nothing to say about Pisa, ... but a great deal (if I could say
    it) about <i>you</i>, who do what is wrong by your own confession and are
    ill because of it and make people uneasy&mdash;now <i>is</i> it right
    altogether? is it right to do wrong?... for it comes to <i>that</i>:&mdash;and
    is it kind to do so much wrong?... for it comes almost to <i>that</i>
    besides. Ah&mdash;you should not indeed! I seem to see quite plainly that
    you will be ill in a serious way, if you do not take care and take
    exercise; and so you must consent to be teazed a little into taking
    both. And if you will not take them here ... or not so effectually as
    in other places; <i>why not go with your Italian friends</i>? Have you
    thought of it at all? <i>I</i> have been thinking since yesterday that it
    might be best for you to go at once, now that the probability has
    turned quite against me. If I were going, I should ask you not to do
    so immediately ... but you see how unlikely it is!&mdash;although I mean
    still to speak my whole thoughts&mdash;I <i>will do that</i> ... even though
    for the mere purpose of self-satisfaction. George came last night&mdash;but
    there is an adverse star this morning, and neither of us has the
    opportunity necessary. Only both he and I <i>will speak</i>&mdash;that is
    certain. And Arabel had the kindness to say yesterday that if I liked
    to go, she would go with me at whatever hazard&mdash;which is very
    kind&mdash;but you know I could not&mdash;it would not be right of me. And
    perhaps after all we may gain the point lawfully; and if not ... at
    the worst ... the winter may be warm (it is better to fall into the
    hands of God, as the Jew said) and I may lose less strength than
    usual, ... having more than usual to lose ... and altogether it may
    not be so bad an alternative. As to being the cause of any anger
    against my sister, you would not advise me into such a position, I am
    sure&mdash;it would be untenable for one moment.
</p>
<p>
    But <i>you</i> ... in that case, ... would it not be good for your head if
    you went at once? I praise myself for saying so to you&mdash;yet if it
    really is good for you, I don't deserve the praising at all. And how
    was it on Saturday&mdash;that question I did not ask yesterday&mdash;with Ben
    Jonson and the amateurs? I thought of you at the time&mdash;I mean, on that
    Saturday evening, nevertheless.

<p>
    I walked to town, this morning, and back again&mdash;so that when I found
    your note on my return, and knew what you had been enjoining me in the
    way of exercise, I seemed as if I knew, too, why that energetic fit
    had possessed me and why I succumbed to it so readily. You shall never
    have to intimate twice to me that such an insignificant thing, even,
    as the taking exercise should be done. Besides, I have many motives
    now for wishing to continue well. But Italy <i>just now</i>&mdash;Oh, no! My
    friends would go through Pisa, too.
</p>
<p>
    On that subject I must not speak. And you have 'more strength to
    lose,' and are so well, evidently so well; that is, so much better, so
    sure to be still better&mdash;can it be that you will not go!
</p>
<p>
    Here are your new notes on my verses. Where are my words for the
    thanks? But you know what I feel, and shall feel&mdash;ever feel&mdash;for these
    and for all. The notes would be beyond price to me if they came from
    some dear Phemius of a teacher&mdash;but from you!
</p>
<p>
    The Theatricals 'went off' with great éclat, and the performance was
    really good, really clever or better. Forster's 'Kitely' was very
    emphatic and earnest, and grew into great interest, quite up to the
    poet's allotted tether, which is none of the longest. He pitched the
    character's key note too gravely, I thought; <i>beginning</i> with
    certainty, rather than mere suspicion, of evil. Dickens' 'Bobadil'
    <i>was</i> capital&mdash;with perhaps a little too much of the consciousness of
    entire cowardice ... which I don't so willingly attribute to the noble
    would-be pacificator of Europe, besieger of Strigonium &amp;c.&mdash;but the
    end of it all was really pathetic, as it should be, for Bobadil is
    only too clever for the company of fools he makes wonderment for:
    having once the misfortune to relish their society, and to need but
    too pressingly their 'tobacco-money,' what can he do but suit himself
    to their capacities?&mdash;And D. Jerrold was very amusing and clever in
    his 'Country Gull'&mdash;And Mr. Leech superb in the Town Master Mathew.
    All were good, indeed, and were voted good, and called on, and cheered
    off, and praised heartily behind their backs and before the curtain.
    Stanfield's function had exercise solely in the touching up (very
    effectively) sundry 'Scenes'&mdash;painted scenes&mdash;and the dresses, which
    were perfect, had the advantage of Mr. Maclise's experience. And&mdash;all
    is told!
</p>
<p>
    And now; I shall hear, you promise me, if anything occurs&mdash;with what
    feeling, I wait and hope, you know. If there is <i>no</i> best of reasons
    against it, Saturday, you remember, is my day&mdash;This fine weather, too!

<p>
    I have spoken again, and the result is that we are in precisely the
    same position; only with bitterer feelings on one side. If I go or
    stay they <i>must</i> be bitter: words have been said that I cannot easily
    forget, nor remember without pain; and yet I really do almost smile in
    the midst of it all, to think how I was treated this morning as an
    undutiful daughter because I tried to put on my gloves ... for there
    was no worse provocation. At least he complained of the undutifulness
    and rebellion (!!!) of everyone in the house&mdash;and when I asked if he
    meant that reproach for <i>me</i>, the answer was that he meant it for all
    of us, one with another. And I could not get an answer. He would not
    even grant me the consolation of thinking that I sacrificed what I
    supposed to be good, to <i>him</i>. I told him that my prospects of health
    seemed to me to depend on taking this step, but that through my
    affection for him, I was ready to sacrifice those to his pleasure if
    he exacted it&mdash;only it was necessary to my self-satisfaction in future
    years, to understand definitely that the sacrifice <i>was</i> exacted by
    him and <i>was</i> made to him, ... and not thrown away blindly and by a
    misapprehension. And he would not answer <i>that</i>. I might do my own
    way, he said&mdash;<i>he</i> would not speak&mdash;<i>he</i> would not say that he was not
    displeased with me, nor the contrary:&mdash;I had better do what I
    liked:&mdash;for his part, he washed his hands of me altogether.
</p>
<p>
    And so I have been very wise&mdash;witness how my eyes are swelled with
    annotations and reflections on all this! The best of it is that now
    George himself admits I can do no more in the way of speaking, ... I
    have no spell for charming the dragons, ... and allows me to be
    passive and enjoins me to be tranquil, and not 'make up my mind' to
    any dreadful exertion for the future. Moreover he advises me to go on
    with the preparations for the voyage, and promises to state the case
    himself at the last hour to the 'highest authority'; and judge finally
    whether it be possible for me to go with the necessary companionship.
    And it seems best to go to Malta on the 3rd of October&mdash;if at all ...
    from steam-packet reasons ... without excluding Pisa ... remember ...
    by any means.
</p>
<p>
    Well!&mdash;and what do you think? Might it be desirable for me to give up
    the whole? Tell me. I feel aggrieved of course and wounded&mdash;and
    whether I go or stay that feeling must last&mdash;I cannot help it. But my
    spirits sink altogether at the thought of leaving England <i>so</i>&mdash;and
    then I doubt about Arabel and Stormie ... and it seems to me that I
    <i>ought not</i> to mix them up in a business of this kind where the
    advantage is merely personal to myself. On the other side, George
    holds that if I give up and stay even, there will be displeasure just
    the same, ... and that, when once gone, the irritation will exhaust
    and smooth itself away&mdash;which however does not touch my chief
    objection. Would it be better ... more <i>right</i> ... to give it up?
    Think for me. Even if I hold on to the last, at the last I shall be
    thrown off&mdash;<i>that</i> is my conviction. But ... shall I give up <i>at
    once</i>? Do think for me.
</p>
<p>
    And I have thought that if you like to come on Friday instead of
    Saturday ... as there is the uncertainty about next week, ... it would
    divide the time more equally: but let it be as you like and according
    to circumstances as you see them. Perhaps you have decided to go at
    once with your friends&mdash;who knows? I wish I could know that you were
    better to-day. May God bless you

<p>
    You have said to me more than once that you wished I might never know
    certain feelings <i>you</i> had been forced to endure. I suppose all of us
    have the proper place where a blow should fall to be felt most&mdash;and I
    truly wish <i>you</i> may never feel what I have to bear in looking on,
    quite powerless, and silent, while you are subjected to this
    treatment, which I refuse to characterize&mdash;so blind is it <i>for</i>
    blindness. I think I ought to understand what a father may exact, and
    a child should comply with; and I respect the most ambiguous of love's
    caprices if they give never so slight a clue to their all-justifying
    source. Did I, when you signified to me the probable objections&mdash;you
    remember what&mdash;to myself, my own happiness,&mdash;did I once allude to,
    much less argue against, or refuse to acknowledge those objections?
    For I wholly sympathize, however it go against me, with the highest,
    wariest, pride and love for you, and the proper jealousy and vigilance
    they entail&mdash;but now, and here, the jewel is not being over guarded,
    but ruined, cast away. And whoever is privileged to interfere should
    do so in the possessor's own interest&mdash;all common sense
    interferes&mdash;all rationality against absolute no-reason at all. And you
    ask whether you ought to obey this no-reason? I will tell you: all
    passive obedience and implicit submission of will and intellect is by
    far too easy, if well considered, to be the course prescribed by God
    to Man in this life of probation&mdash;for they <i>evade</i> probation
    altogether, though foolish people think otherwise. Chop off your legs,
    you will never go astray; stifle your reason altogether and you will
    find it is difficult to reason ill. 'It is hard to make these
    sacrifices!'&mdash;not so hard as to lose the reward or incur the penalty
    of an Eternity to come; 'hard to effect them, then, and go through
    with them'&mdash;<i>not</i> hard, when the leg is to be <i>cut off</i>&mdash;that it is
    rather harder to keep it quiet on a stool, I know very well. The
    partial indulgence, the proper exercise of one's faculties, there is
    the difficulty and problem for solution, set by that Providence which
    might have made the laws of Religion as indubitable as those of
    vitality, and revealed the articles of belief as certainly as that
    condition, for instance, by which we breathe so many times in a minute
    to support life. But there is no reward proposed for the feat of
    breathing, and a great one for that of believing&mdash;consequently there
    must go a great deal more of voluntary effort to this latter than is
    implied in the getting absolutely rid of it at once, by adopting the
    direction of an infallible church, or private judgment of another&mdash;for
    all our life is some form of religion, and all our action some belief,
    and there is but one law, however modified, for the greater and the
    less. In your case I do think you are called upon to do your duty to
    yourself; that is, to God in the end. Your own reason should examine
    the whole matter in dispute by every light which can be put in
    requisition; and every interest that appears to be affected by your
    conduct should have its utmost claims considered&mdash;your father's in the
    first place; and that interest, not in the miserable limits of a few
    days' pique or whim in which it would seem to express itself; but in
    its whole extent ... the <i>hereafter</i> which all momentary passion
    prevents him seeing ... indeed, the <i>present</i> on either side which
    everyone else must see. And this examination made, with whatever
    earnestness you will, I do think and am sure that on its conclusion
    you should act, in confidence that a duty has been performed ...
    <i>difficult</i>, or how were it a duty? Will it <i>not</i> be infinitely harder
    to act so than to blindly adopt his pleasure, and die under it? Who
    can <i>not</i> do that?
</p>
<p>
    I fling these hasty rough words over the paper, fast as they will
    fall&mdash;knowing to whom I cast them, and that any sense they may contain
    or point to, will be caught and understood, and presented in a better
    light. The hard thing ... this is all I want to say ... is to act on
    one's own best conviction&mdash;not to abjure it and accept another will,
    and say '<i>there</i> is my plain duty'&mdash;easy it is, whether plain or no!
</p>
<p>
    How 'all changes!' When I first knew you&mdash;you know what followed. I
    supposed you to labour under an incurable complaint&mdash;and, of course,
    to be completely dependent on your father for its commonest
    alleviations; the moment after that inconsiderate letter, I reproached
    myself bitterly with the selfishness apparently involved in any
    proposition I might then have made&mdash;for though I have never been at
    all frightened of the world, nor mistrustful of my power to deal with
    it, and get my purpose out of it if once I thought it worth while, yet
    I could not but feel the consideration, of <i>what</i> failure would <i>now</i>
    be, paralyse all effort even in fancy. When you told me lately that
    'you could never be poor'&mdash;all my solicitude was at an end&mdash;I had but
    myself to care about, and I told you, what I believed and believe,
    that I can at any time amply provide for that, and that I could
    cheerfully and confidently undertake the removing <i>that</i> obstacle. Now
    again the circumstances shift&mdash;and you are in what I should wonder at
    as the veriest slavery&mdash;and I who <i>could</i> free you from it, I am here
    scarcely daring to write ... though I know you must feel for me and
    forgive what forces itself from me ... what retires so mutely into my
    heart at your least word ... what <i>shall not</i> be again written or
    spoken, if you so will ... that I should be made happy beyond all hope
    of expression by. Now while I <i>dream</i>, let me once dream! I would
    marry you now and thus&mdash;I would come when you let me, and go when you
    bade me&mdash;I would be no more than one of your brothers&mdash;'<i>no
    more</i>'&mdash;that is, instead of getting to-morrow for Saturday, I should
    get Saturday as well&mdash;two hours for one&mdash;when your head ached I
    should be <i>here</i>. I deliberately choose the realization of that dream

<i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, September 27, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I had your letter late last night, everyone almost, being out of the
    house by an accident, so that it was left in the letter-box, and if I
    had wished to answer it before I saw you, it had scarcely been
    possible.
</p>
<p>
    But it will be the same thing&mdash;for you know as well as if you saw my
    answer, what it must be, what it cannot choose but be, on pain of
    sinking me so infinitely below not merely your level but my own, that
    the depth cannot bear a glance down. Yet, though I am not made of such
    clay as to admit of my taking a base advantage of certain noble
    extravagances, (and that I am not I thank God for your sake) I will
    say, I must say, that your words in this letter have done me good and
    made me happy, ... that I thank and bless you for them, ... and that
    to receive such a proof of attachment from <i>you</i>, not only overpowers
    every present evil, but seems to me a full and abundant amends for the
    merely personal sufferings of my whole life. When I had read that
    letter last night I <i>did</i> think so. I looked round and round for the
    small bitternesses which for several days had been bitter to me, and I
    could not find one of them. The tear-marks went away in the moisture
    of new, happy tears. Why, how else could I have felt? how else do you
    think I could? How would any woman have felt ... who could feel at all
    ... hearing such words said (though 'in a dream' indeed) by such a
    speaker?
</p>
<p>
    And now listen to me in turn. You have touched me more profoundly than
    I thought even <i>you</i> could have touched me&mdash;my heart was full when you
    came here to-day. Henceforward I am yours for everything but to do you
    harm&mdash;and I am yours too much, in my heart, ever to consent to do you
    harm in that way. If I could consent to do it, not only should I be
    less loyal ... but in one sense, less yours. I say this to you without
    drawback and reserve, because it is all I am able to say, and perhaps
    all I <i>shall</i> be able to say. However this may be, a promise goes to
    you in it that none, except God and your will, shall interpose between
    you and me, ... I mean, that if He should free me within a moderate
    time from the trailing chain of this weakness, I will then be to you
    whatever at that hour you shall choose ... whether friend or more than
    friend ... a friend to the last in any case. So it rests with God and
    with you&mdash;only in the meanwhile you are most absolutely free ...
    'unentangled' (as they call it) by the breadth of a thread&mdash;and if I
    did not know that you considered yourself so, I would not see you any
    more, let the effort cost me what it might. You may force me <i>feel</i>:
    ... but you cannot force me to <i>think</i> contrary to my first thought
    ... that it were better for you to forget me at once in one relation.
    And if better for <i>you</i>, can it be bad for <i>me</i>? which flings me down
    on the stone-pavement of the logicians.
</p>
<p>
    And now if I ask a boon of you, will you forget afterwards that it
    ever was asked? I have hesitated a great deal; but my face is down on
    the stone-pavement&mdash;no&mdash;I will not ask to-day&mdash;It shall be for another
    day&mdash;and may God bless you on this and on those that come after, my
    dearest friend.

</p>
<p>
    The other asking shall come in its season ... some day before I go, if
    I go. It only relates to a restitution&mdash;and you cannot guess it if you

    ... unless we take the dreary alternative of Madeira!&mdash;or Cadiz! Even
    suppose Madeira, ... why it were for a few months alone&mdash;and there
    would be no temptation to loiter as in Italy.

    <i>Don't</i> think too hardly of poor Papa. You have his wrong side ... his

<p>
    Are you better, I wonder? and taking exercise and trying to be better?
    May God bless you! Tuesday need not be the last day if you like to
    take one more besides&mdash;for there is no going until the fourth or
    seventh, ... and the seventh is the more probable of those two. But

<p>
    I have read to the last line of your 'Rosicrucian'; and my scepticism
    grew and grew through Hume's process of doubtful doubts, and at last
    rose to the full stature of incredulity ... for I never could believe
    Shelley capable of such a book (call it a book!), not even with a
    flood of boarding-school idiocy dashed in by way of dilution.
    Altogether it roused me to deny myself so far as to look at the date
    of the book, and to get up and travel to the other end of the room to
    confront it with other dates in the 'Letters from Abroad' ... (I, who
    never think of a date except the 'A.D.,' and am inclined every now and
    then to write <i>that</i> down as 1548 ...) well! and on comparing these
    dates in these two volumes before my eyes, I find that your
    Rosicrucian was 'printed for Stockdale' in <i>1822</i>, and that Shelley
    <i>died in the July of the same year</i>!!&mdash;There, is a vindicating fact
    for you! And unless the 'Rosicrucian' went into more editions than
    one, and dates here from a later one, ... which is not ascertainable
    from this fragment of a titlepage, ... the innocence of the great poet
    stands proved&mdash;now doesn't it? For nobody will say that he published
    such a book in the last year of his life, in the maturity of his
    genius, and that Godwin's daughter helped him in it! That 'dripping
    dew' from the skeleton is the only living word in the book!&mdash;which
    really amused me notwithstanding, from the intense absurdity of the
    whole composition ... descriptions ... sentiments ... and morals.
</p>
<p>
    Judge yourself if I had not better say 'No' about the cloak! I would
    take it if you wished such a kindness to me&mdash;and although you might
    find it very useful to yourself ... or to your mother or sister ...
    still if you <i>wished</i> me to take it I should like to have it, and the
    mantle of the prophet might bring me down something of his spirit! but
    do you remember ... do you consider ... how many talkers there are in
    this house, and what would be talked&mdash;or that it is not worth while to
    provoke it all? And Papa, knowing it, would not like it&mdash;and
    altogether it is far better, believe me, that you should keep your own
    cloak, and I, the thought of the kindness you meditated in respect to
    it. I have heard nothing more&mdash;nothing.
</p>
<p>
    I was asked the other day by a very young friend of mine ... the
    daughter of an older friend who once followed you up-stairs in this
    house ... Mr. Hunter, an Independent minister ... for 'Mr. Browning's
    autograph.' She wants it for a collection ... for her album&mdash;and so,
    will you write out a verse or two on one side of note paper ... not as
    you write for the printers ... and let me keep my promise and send it
    to her? I forgot to ask you before. Or one verse will do ... anything
    will do ... and don't let me be bringing you into vexation. It need
    not be of MS. rarity.
</p>
<p>
    You are not better ... really ... I fear. And your mother's being ill
    affects you more than you like to admit, I fear besides. Will you,
    when you write, say how <i>both</i> are ... nothing extenuating, you know.
    May God bless you, my dearest friend.

<p>
    Well, let us hope against hope in the sad matter of the novel&mdash;yet,
    yet,&mdash;it <i>is</i> by Shelley, if you will have the truth&mdash;as I happen to
    <i>know</i>&mdash;proof <i>last</i> being that Leigh Hunt told me he unearthed it in
    Shelley's own library at Marlow once, to the writer's horror and
    shame&mdash;'He snatched it out of my hands'&mdash;said H. Yet I thrust it into
    yours ... so much for the subtle fence of friends who reach your heart
    by a side-thrust, as I told you on Tuesday, after the enemy has fallen
    back breathless and baffled. As for the date, that Stockdale was a
    notorious pirate and raker-up of rash publications ... and, do you
    know, I suspect the <i>title-page</i> is all that boasts such novelty,&mdash;see
    if the <i>book</i>, the inside leaves, be not older evidently!&mdash;a common
    trick of the 'trade' to this day. The history of this and 'Justrozzi,'
    as it is spelt,&mdash;the other novel,&mdash;may be read in Medwin's
    'Conversations'&mdash;and, as I have been told, in Lady Ch. Bury's
    'Reminiscences' or whatever she calls them ... the 'Guistrozzi' was
    <i>certainly</i> 'written in concert with'&mdash;somebody or other ... for I
    confess the whole story grows monstrous and even the froth of wine
    strings itself in bright bubbles,&mdash;ah, but this was the scum of the
    fermenting vat, do you see? I am happy to say I forget the novel
    entirely, or almost&mdash;and only keep the exact impression which you have
    gained ... through me! 'The fair cross of gold <i>he dashed on the
    floor</i>'&mdash;(<i>that</i> is my pet-line ... because the 'chill dew' of a place
    not commonly supposed to favour humidity is a plagiarism from Lewis's
    'Monk,' it now flashes on me! Yes, Lewis, too, puts the phrase into
    intense italics.) And now, please read a chorus in the 'Prometheus
    Unbound' or a scene from the 'Cenci'&mdash;and join company with Shelley
    again!
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;From 'chill dew' I come to the <i>cloak</i>&mdash;you are quite right&mdash;and I
    give up that fancy. Will you, then, take one more precaution when
    <i>all</i> proper safe-guards have been adopted; and, when <i>everything</i> is
    sure, contrive some one sureness besides, against cold or wind or
    sea-air; and say '<i>this</i>&mdash;for the cloak which is not here, and to help
    the heart's wish which is,'&mdash;so I shall be there <i>palpably</i>. Will you
    do this? Tell me you will, to-morrow&mdash;and tell me all good news.
</p>
<p>
    My Mother suffers still.... I hope she is no worse&mdash;but a little
    better&mdash;certainly better. I am better too, in my unimportant way.
</p>
<p>
    Now I will write you the verses ... some easy ones out of a paper-full
    meant to go between poem and poem in my next number, and break the
    shock of collision.
</p>
<p>
    Let me kiss your hand&mdash;dearest! My heart and life&mdash;all is yours, and

    Tuesday is given up in full council. The thing is beyond doubting of,
    as George says and as you thought yesterday. And then George has it in
    his head to beguile the Duke of Palmella out of a smaller cabin, so
    that I might sail from the Thames on the twentieth&mdash;and whether he
    succeeds or not, I humbly confess that one of the chief advantages of
    the new plan if not the very chief (as <i>I</i> see it) is just in the
    <i>delay</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Your spring-song is full of beauty as you know very well&mdash;and 'that's
    the wise thrush,' so characteristic of you (and of the thrush too)
    that I was sorely tempted to ask you to write it 'twice over,' ... and
    not send the first copy to Mary Hunter notwithstanding my promise to
    her. And now when you come to print these fragments, would it not be
    well if you were to stoop to the vulgarism of prefixing some word of
    introduction, as other people do, you know, ... a title ... a name?
    You perplex your readers often by casting yourself on their
    intelligence in these things&mdash;and although it is true that readers in
    general are stupid and can't understand, it is still more true that
    they are lazy and won't understand ... and they don't catch your point
    of sight at first unless you think it worth while to push them by the
    shoulders and force them into the right place. Now these fragments ...
    you mean to print them with a line between ... and not one word at the
    top of it ... now don't you! And then people will read
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Oh, to be in England
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">and say to themselves ... 'Why who is this? ... who's out of England?'
    Which is an extreme case of course; but you will see what I mean ...
    and often I have observed how some of the very most beautiful of your
    lyrics have suffered just from your disdain of the usual tactics of
    writers in this one respect.
</p>
<p>
    And you are not better, still&mdash;you are worse instead of better ... are
    you not? Tell me&mdash;And what can you mean about 'unimportance,' when you
    were worse last week ... this expiring week ... than ever before, by
    your own confession? And now?&mdash;And your mother?
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;I promise! And so, ... <i>Elijah</i> will be missed instead of his
    mantle ... which will be a losing contract after all. But it shall be
    as you say. May you be able to say that you are better! God bless you.

    Never think of the 'White Slave.' I had just taken it up. The trash of

    I should certainly think that the Duke of Palmella may be induced, and
    with no great difficulty, to give up a cabin under the
    circumstances&mdash;and <i>then</i> the plan becomes really objection-proof, so
    far as mortal plans go. But now you must think all the boldlier about
    whatever difficulties remain, just because they are so much the fewer.
    It <i>is</i> cold already in the mornings and evenings&mdash;cold and (this
    morning) foggy&mdash;I did not ask if you continue to go out from time to
    time.... I am sure you <i>should</i>,&mdash;you would so prepare yourself

    On Tuesday Mr. Kenyon is to be here or not to be here, he

    never could grumble against him, so good and kind as he is&mdash;but he may
    not come after all to-morrow&mdash;so it is not grudging the obolus to
    Belisarius, but the squandering of the last golden days at the bottom
    of the purse.

    Do I 'stand'&mdash;Do I walk? Yes&mdash;most uprightly. I 'walk upright every
    day.' Do I go out? no, never. And I am not to be scolded for <i>that</i>,
    because when you were looking at the sun to-day, I was marking the

    Well, dearest, at all events I get up with the assurance I shall see

</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon never came. My sisters met him in the street, and he had
    been 'detained all day in the city and would certainly be here
    to-morrow,' Wednesday! And so you see what has happened to Wednesday!
    Moreover he may come besides on Thursday, ... I can answer for
    nothing. Only if I do not write and if you find Thursday admissible,
    will you come then? In the case of an obstacle, you shall hear. And it
    is not (in the meantime) my fault&mdash;now is it? I have been quite enough
    vexed about it, indeed.
</p>
<p>
    Did the Monday work work harm to the head, I wonder? I do fear so that
    you won't get through those papers with impunity&mdash;especially if the
    plays are to come after ... though ever so 'gently.' And if you are to
    suffer, it would be right to tongue-tie that silver Bell, and leave
    the congregations to their selling of cabbages. Which is
    unphilanthropic of me perhaps, ... <span title="ô philtate">&omega; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Be sure that I shall be 'bold' when the time for going comes&mdash;and both
    bold and capable of the effort. I am desired to keep to the respirator
    and the cabin for a day or two, while the cold can reach us; and
    midway in the bay of Biscay some change of climate may be felt, they
    say. There is no sort of danger for me; except that I shall <i>stay in
    England</i>. And why is it that I feel to-night more than ever almost, as
    if I should stay in England? Who can tell? <i>I</i> can tell one thing.
    <i>If</i> I stay, it will not be from a failure in my resolution&mdash;<i>that
    will</i> not be&mdash;<i>shall</i> not be. Yes&mdash;and Mr. Kenyon and I agreed the
    other day that there was something of the tigress-nature very
    distinctly cognisable under what he is pleased to call my
    'Ba-lambishness.'
</p>
<p>
    Then, on Thursday!... unless something happens to <i>Thursday</i> ... and I
    shall write in that case. And I trust to you (as always) to attend to
    your own convenience&mdash;just as you may trust to me to remember my own
    'boon.' Ah&mdash;you are curious, I think! Which is scarcely wise of
    you&mdash;because it <i>may</i>, you know, be the roc's egg after all. But no,
    it <i>isn't</i>&mdash;I will say just so much. And besides I <i>did</i> say that it
    was a 'restitution,' which limits the guesses if it does not put an
    end to them. Unguessable, I choose it to be.

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, October 11, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Dear Mr. Kenyon has been here again, and talking so (in his kindness
    too) about the probabilities as to Pisa being against me ... about all
    depending 'on one throw' and the 'dice being loaded' &amp;c. ... that I
    looked at him aghast as if he looked at the future through the folded
    curtain and was licensed to speak oracles:&mdash;and ever since I have been
    out of spirits ... oh, out of spirits&mdash;and must write myself back
    again, or try. After all he may be wrong like another&mdash;and I should
    tell you that he reasons altogether from the delay ... and that 'the
    cabins will therefore be taken' and the 'circular bills' out of reach!
    He <i>said</i> that one of his purposes in staying in town, was to
    '<i>knout</i>' me every day&mdash;didn't he?
</p>
<p>
    Well&mdash;George will probably speak before <i>he</i> leaves town, which will
    be on Monday! and now that the hour approaches, I do feel as if the
    house stood upon gunpowder, and as if I held Guy Fawkes's lantern in
    my right hand. And no: I shall not go. The obstacles will not be those
    of Mr. Kenyon's finding&mdash;and what their precise character will be I do
    not see distinctly. Only that they will be sufficient, and thrown by
    one hand just where the wheel should turn, ... <i>that</i>, I see&mdash;and you
    will, in a few days.
</p>
<p>
    Did you go to Moxon's and settle the printing matter? Tell me. And
    what was the use of telling Mr. Kenyon that you were 'quite well' when
    you know you are not? Will you say to me how you are, saying the
    truth? and also how your mother is?
</p>
<p>
    To show the significance of the omission of those evening or rather
    night visits of Papa's&mdash;for they came sometimes at eleven, and
    sometimes at twelve&mdash;I will tell you that he used to sit and talk in
    them, and then <i>always</i> kneel and pray with me and for me&mdash;which I
    used of course to feel as a proof of very kind and affectionate
    sympathy on his part, and which has proportionably pained me in the
    withdrawing. They were no ordinary visits, you observe, ... and he
    could not well throw me further from him than by ceasing to pay
    them&mdash;the thing is quite expressively significant. Not that I pretend
    to complain, nor to have reason to complain. One should not be
    grateful for kindness, only while it lasts: <i>that</i> would be a
    short-breathed gratitude. I just tell you the fact, proving that it
    cannot be accidental.
</p>
<p>
    Did you ever, ever tire me? Indeed no&mdash;you never did. And do
    understand that I am not to be tired 'in that way,' though as Mr. Boyd
    said once of his daughter, one may be so 'far too effeminate.' No&mdash;if
    I were put into a crowd I should be tired soon&mdash;or, apart from the
    crowd, if you made me discourse orations De Coronâ ... concerning your
    bag even ... I should be tired soon&mdash;though peradventure not very much
    sooner than you who heard. But on the smooth ground of quiet
    conversation (particularly when three people don't talk at once as my
    brothers do ... to say the least!) I last for a long while:&mdash;not to
    say that I have the pretension of being as good and inexhaustible a
    listener to your own speaking as you could find in the world. So
    please not to accuse me of being tired again. I can't be tired, and
    won't be tired, you see.
</p>
<p>
    And now, since I began to write this, there is a new evil and
    anxiety&mdash;a worse anxiety than any&mdash;for one of my brothers is ill; had
    been unwell for some days and we thought nothing of it, till to-day
    Saturday: and the doctors call it a fever of the typhoid character ...
    not typhus yet ... but we are very uneasy. You must not come on
    Wednesday if an infectious fever be in the house&mdash;<i>that</i> must be out
    of the question. May God bless you&mdash;I am quite heavy-hearted to-day,
    but never less yours,

<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, October 13, 1845].
</p>
<p>
    These are bad news, dearest&mdash;all bad, except the enduring comfort of
    your regard; the illness of your brother is worst ... that <i>would</i>
    stay you, and is the first proper obstacle. I shall not attempt to
    speak and prove my feelings,&mdash;you know what even Flush is to me
    through you: I wait in anxiety for the next account.
</p>
<p>
    If after all you do <i>not</i> go to Pisa; why, we must be cheerful and
    wise, and take courage and hope. I cannot but see with your eyes and
    from your place, you know,&mdash;and will let this all be one surprizing
    and deplorable mistake of mere love and care ... but no such another
    mistake ought to be suffered, if you escape the effects of this. I
    will not cease to believe in a better event, till the very last,
    however, and it is a deep satisfaction that all has been made plain
    and straight up to this strange and sad interposition like a bar. You
    have done <i>your</i> part, at least&mdash;with all that forethought and counsel
    from friends and adequate judges of the case&mdash;so, if the bar <i>will</i>
    not move, you will consider&mdash;will you not, dearest?&mdash;where one may
    best encamp in the unforbidden country, and wait the spring and fine
    weather. Would it be advisable to go where Mr. Kenyon suggested, or
    elsewhere? Oh, these vain wishes ... the will here, and no means!
</p>
<p>
    My life is bound up with yours&mdash;my own, first and last love. What
    wonder if I feared to tire you&mdash;I who, knowing you as I do, admiring
    what is so admirable (let me speak), loving what must needs be loved,
    fain to learn what you only can teach; proud of so much, happy in so
    much of you; I, who, for all this, neither come to admire, nor feel
    proud, nor be taught,&mdash;but only, only to live with you and be by
    you&mdash;that is love&mdash;for I <i>know</i> the rest, as I say. I know those
    qualities are in you ... but at them I could get in so many ways.... I
    have your books, here are my letters you give me; you would answer my
    questions were <i>I</i> in Pisa&mdash;well, and it all would amount to nothing,
    infinitely much as I know it is; to nothing if I could not sit by you
    and see you.... I can stop at that, but not before. And it seems
    strange to me how little ... less than little I have laid open of my
    feelings, the nature of them to you&mdash;I smile to think how if all this
    while I had been acting with the profoundest policy in intention, so
    as to pledge myself to nothing I could not afterwards perform with the
    most perfect ease and security, I should have done not much unlike
    what I <i>have</i> done&mdash;to be sure, one word includes many or all ... but
    I have not said ... what I will not even now say ... you will
    <i>know</i>&mdash;in God's time to which I trust.
</p>
<p>
    I will answer your note now&mdash;the questions. I did go&mdash;(it may amuse
    you to write on)&mdash;to Moxon's. First let me tell you that when I called
    there the Saturday before, his brother (in his absence) informed me,
    replying to the question when it came naturally in turn with a round
    of like enquiries, that your poems continued to sell 'singularly
    well'&mdash;they would 'end in bringing a clear profit,' he said. I thought
    to catch him, and asked if they <i>had</i> done so ... 'Oh; not at the
    beginning ... it takes more time&mdash;he answered. On Thursday I saw
    Moxon&mdash;he spoke rather encouragingly of my own prospects. I send him a
    sheetful to-morrow, I believe, and we are 'out' on the 1st of next
    month. Tennyson, by the way, has got his pension, £200 per annum&mdash;by
    the other way, Moxon has bought the MSS. of Keats in the possession of
    Taylor the publisher, and is going to bring out a complete edition;
    which is pleasant to hear.
</p>
<p>
    After settling with Moxon I went to Mrs. Carlyle's&mdash;who told me
    characteristic quaintnesses of Carlyle's father and mother over the
    tea she gave me. And all yesterday, you are to know, I was in a
    permanent mortal fright&mdash;for my uncle came in the morning to intreat
    me to go to Paris in <i>the evening</i> about some urgent business of
    his,&mdash;a five-minutes matter with his brother there,&mdash;and the affair
    being really urgent and material to his and the brother's interest,
    and no substitute being to be thought of, I was forced to promise to
    go&mdash;in case a letter, which would arrive in Town at noon, should not
    prove satisfactory. So I calculated times, and found I could be at
    Paris to-morrow, and back again, <i>certainly</i> by Wednesday&mdash;and so not
    lose you on that day&mdash;oh, the fear I had!&mdash;but I was sure then and
    now, that the 17th would not see you depart. But night came, and the
    last Dover train left, and I drew breath freely&mdash;this morning I find
    the letter was all right&mdash;so may it be with all worse apprehensions!
    What you fear, precisely that, never happens, as Napoleon observed and
    thereon grew bold. I had stipulated for an hour's notice, if go I
    must&mdash;and that was to be wholly spent in writing to you&mdash;for in quiet
    consternation my mother cared for my carpet bag.
</p>
<p>
    And so, I shall hear from you to-morrow ... that is, you will write
    <i>then</i>, telling me <i>all</i> about your brother. As for what you say, with
    the kindest intentions, 'of fever-contagion' and keeping away on
    Wednesday on <i>that</i> account, it is indeed 'out of the question,'&mdash;for
    a first reason (which dispenses with any second) because I disbelieve
    altogether in contagion from fevers, and especially from typhus
    fevers&mdash;as do much better-informed men than myself&mdash;I speak quite
    advisedly. If there should be only <i>that</i> reason, therefore, you will
    not deprive me of the happiness of seeing you next Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
    I am not well&mdash;have a cold, influenza or some unpleasant thing, but am
    better than yesterday&mdash;My mother is much better, I think (she and my
    sister are resolute non-contagionists, mind you that!)
</p>

    God bless you and all you love! dearest, I am your

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.<br>
[Post-mark, October 14, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    It was the merest foolishness in me to write about fevers and the rest
    as I did to-day, just as if it could do any good, all the wringing of
    hands in the world. And there is no typhus <i>yet</i> ... and no danger of
    any sort I hope and trust!&mdash;and how weak it is that habit of spreading
    the cloud which is in you all around you, how weak and selfish ... and
    unlike what <i>you</i> would do ... just as you are unlike Mr. Kenyon. And
    you <i>are</i> unlike him&mdash;and you were right on Thursday when you said
    so, and I was wrong in setting up a phrase on the other side ... only
    what I said came by an instinct because you seemed to be giving him
    all the sunshine to use and carry, which should not be after all. But
    you are unlike him and must be ... seeing that the producers must
    differ from the 'nati consumere fruges' in the intellectual as in the
    material. You create and he enjoys, and the work makes you pale and
    the pleasure makes him ruddy, and it is so of a necessity. So differs
    the man of genius from the man of letters&mdash;and then dear Mr. Kenyon is
    not even a man of letters in a full sense ... he is rather a Sybarite
    of letters. Do you think he ever knew what mental labour is? I fancy
    not. Not more than he has known what mental inspiration is! And not
    more than he has known what the strife of the heart is ... with all
    his tenderness and sensibility. He seems to me to <i>evade</i> pain, and
    where he suffers at all to do so rather negatively than positively ...
    if you understand what I mean by that ... rather by a want than by a
    blow: the secret of all being that he has a certain latitudinarianism
    (not indifferentism) in his life and affections, and has no capacity
    for concentration and intensity. Partly by temperament and partly by
    philosophy he contrives to keep the sunny side of the street&mdash;though
    never inclined to forget the blind man at the corner. Ah, dear Mr.
    Kenyon: he is magnanimous in toleration, and excellent in
    sympathy&mdash;and he has the love of beauty and the reverence of
    genius&mdash;but the faculty of <i>worship</i> he has not: he will not worship
    aright either your heroes or your gods ... and while you do it he only
    'tolerates' the act in you. Once he said ... not to me ... but I heard
    of it: 'What, if genius should be nothing but scrofula?' and he doubts
    (I very much fear) whether the world is not governed by a throw of
    those very same 'loaded dice,' and no otherwise. Yet he reveres genius
    in the acting of it, and recognizes a God in creation&mdash;only it is but
    'so far,' and not farther. At least I think not&mdash;and I have a right to
    think what I please of him, holding him as I do, in such true
    affection. One of the kindest and most indulgent of human beings has
    he been to me, and I am happy to be grateful to him.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;The Duke of Palmella takes the whole vessel for the 20th
    and therefore if I go it must be on the 17th. Therefore (besides) as
    George must be on sessions to-morrow, he will settle the question with
    Papa to-night. In the meantime our poor Occy is not much better,
    though a little, and is ordered leeches on his head, and is confined
    to his bed and attended by physician and surgeon. It is not decided
    typhus, but they will not answer for its not being infectious; and
    although he is quite at the top of the house, two stories above me, I
    shall not like you to come indeed. And then there will be only room
    for a farewell, and I who am a coward shrink from the saying of it.
    No&mdash;not being able to see you to-morrow, (Mr. Kenyon is to be here
    to-morrow, he says) let us agree to throw away Wednesday. I will
    write, ... you will write perhaps&mdash;and above all things you will
    promise to write by the 'Star' on Monday, that the captain may give me
    your letter at Gibraltar. You promise? But I shall hear from you
    before then, and oftener than once, and you will acquiesce about
    Wednesday and grant at once that there can be no gain, no good, in
    that miserable good-bye-ing. I do not want the pain of it to remember
    you by&mdash;I shall remember very well without it, be sure. Still it shall
    be as you like&mdash;as you shall chose&mdash;and if you are <i>disappointed</i>
    about Wednesday (if it is not vain in me to talk of disappointments)
    why do with Wednesday as you think best ... always understanding that
    there's no risk of infection.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;All this I had written yesterday&mdash;and to-day it all is
    worse than vain. Do not be angry with me&mdash;do not think it my
    fault&mdash;but <i>I do not go to Italy</i> ... it has ended as I feared. What
    passed between George and Papa there is no need of telling: only the
    latter said that I 'might go if I pleased, but that going it would be
    under his heaviest displeasure.' George, in great indignation,
    pressed the question fully: but all was vain ... and I am left in this
    position ... to go, if I please, with his displeasure over me, (which
    after what you have said and after what Mr. Kenyon has said, and after
    what my own conscience and deepest moral convictions say aloud, I
    would unhesitatingly do at this hour!) and necessarily run the risk of
    exposing my sister and brother to that same displeasure ... from which
    risk I shrink and fall back and feel that to incur it, is impossible.
    Dear Mr. Kenyon has been here and we have been talking&mdash;and he sees
    what I see ... that I am justified in going myself, but not in
    bringing others into difficulty. The very kindness and goodness with
    which they desire me (both my sisters) 'not to think of them,'
    naturally makes me think more of them. And so, tell me that I am not
    wrong in taking up my chain again and acquiescing in this hard
    necessity. The bitterest 'fact' of all is, that I had believed Papa to
    have loved me more than he obviously does: but I never regret
    knowledge ... I mean I never would <i>un</i>know anything ... even were it
    the taste of the apples by the Dead sea&mdash;and this must be accepted
    like the rest. In the meantime your letter comes&mdash;and if I could seem
    to be very unhappy after reading it ... why it would be 'all pretence'
    on my part, believe me. Can you care for me so much ... <i>you</i>? Then
    <i>that</i> is light enough to account for all the shadows, and to make
    them almost unregarded&mdash;the shadows of the life behind. Moreover dear
    Occy is somewhat better&mdash;with a pulse only at ninety: and the doctors
    declare that visitors may come to the house without any manner of
    danger. Or I should not trust to your theories&mdash;no, indeed: it was not
    that I expected you to be afraid, but that <i>I</i> was afraid&mdash;and if I am
    not ashamed for <i>that</i>, why at least I am, for being <i>lâche</i> about
    Wednesday, when you thought of hurrying back from Paris only for it!
    You <i>could</i> think <i>that</i>!&mdash;You <i>can</i> care for me so much!&mdash;(I come to
    it again!) When I hold some words to my eyes ... such as these in
    this letter ... I can see nothing beyond them ... no evil, no want.
    There <i>is</i> no evil and no want. Am I wrong in the decision about
    Italy? Could I do otherwise? I had courage and to spare&mdash;but the
    question, you see, did not regard myself wholly. For the rest, the
    'unforbidden country' lies within these four walls. Madeira was
    proposed in vain&mdash;and any part of England would be as objectionable as
    Italy, and not more advantageous to <i>me</i> than Wimpole Street. To take
    courage and be cheerful, as you say, is left as an alternative&mdash;and
    (the winter may be mild!) to fall into the hands of God rather than of
    man: <i>and I shall be here for your November, remember</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And now that you are not well, will you take care? and not come on
    Wednesday unless you are better? and never again bring me <i>wet
    flowers</i>, which probably did all the harm on Thursday? I was afraid
    for you then, though I said nothing. May God bless you.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever yours I am&mdash;your own.
</p>
<p>
    Ninety is not a high pulse ... for a fever of this kind&mdash;is it? and
    the heat diminishes, and his spirits are better&mdash;and we are all much
    easier ... have been both to-day and yesterday indeed.

    Be sure, my own, dearest love, that this is for the best; will be seen

<p>
    Will this note reach you at the 'fatal hour' ... or sooner? At any
    rate it is forced to ask you to take Thursday for Wednesday, inasmuch
    as Mr. Kenyon in his exceeding kindness has put off his journey just
    for <i>me</i>, he says, because he saw me depressed about the decision, and
    wished to come and see me again to-morrow and talk the spirits up, I
    suppose. It is all so kind and good, that I cannot find a voice to
    grumble about the obligation it brings of writing thus. And then, if
    you suffer from cold and influenza, it will be better for you not to
    come for another day, ... I think <i>that</i>, for comfort. Shall I hear
    how you are to-night, I wonder? Dear Occy 'turned the corner,' the
    physician said, yesterday evening, and, although a little fluctuating
    to-day, remains on the whole considerably better. They were just in
    time to keep the fever from turning to typhus.
</p>
<p>
    How fast you print your book, for it is to be out on the first of
    November! Why it comes out suddenly like the sun. Mr. Kenyon asked me
    if I had seen anything you were going to print; and when I mentioned
    the second part of the 'Duchess' and described how your perfect
    rhymes, perfectly new, and all clashing together as by natural
    attraction, had put me at once to shame and admiration, he began to
    praise the first part of the same poem (which I had heard him do
    before, by the way) and extolled it as one of your most striking
    productions.

    Thanks, my dearest, for the good news&mdash;of the fever's abatement&mdash;it is
    good, too, that you write cheerfully, on the whole: what is it to <i>me</i>
    that you write is of <i>me</i> ... I shall never say <i>that</i>! Mr. Kenyon is
    all kindness, and one gets to take it as not so purely natural a
    thing, the showing kindness to those it concerns, and belongs
    to,&mdash;well! On Thursday, then,&mdash;to-morrow! Did you not get a note of
    mine, a hurried note, which was meant for yesterday-afternoon's

    Mr. Forster came yesterday and was very profuse of graciosities: he
    may have, or must have meant well, so we will go on again with the

    My poems went duly to press on Monday night&mdash;there is not much
    <i>correctable</i> in them,&mdash;you make, or you spoil, one of these things;
    that is, <i>I</i> do. I have adopted all your emendations, and thrown in
    lines and words, just a morning's business; but one does not write
    plays so. You may like some of my smaller things, which stop
    interstices, better than what you have seen; I shall wonder to know. I

    While writing this, the <i>Times</i> catches my eye (it just came in) and
    something from the <i>Lancet</i> is extracted, a long article against
    quackery&mdash;and, as I say, this is the first and only sentence I
    read&mdash;'There is scarcely a peer of the realm who is not the patron of
    some quack pill or potion: and the literati too, are deeply tainted.
    We have heard of barbarians who threw quacks and their medicines into
    the sea: but here in England we have Browning, a prince of poets,
    touching the pitch which defiles and making Paracelsus the hero of a
    poem. Sir E.L. Bulwer writes puffs for the water doctors in a style
    worthy of imitation by the scribe that does the poetical for Moses and
    Son. Miss Martineau makes a finessing servant girl her
    physician-general: and Richard Howitt and the Lady aforesaid stand
    God-father and mother to the contemptible mesmeric vagaries of Spencer
    Hall.'&mdash;Even the sweet incense to me fails of its effect if Paracelsus
    is to figure on a level with Priessnitz, and 'Jane'!
</p>
<p>
    What weather, now at last! Think for yourself and for me&mdash;could you
    not go out on such days?
</p>
<p>
    I am quite well now&mdash;cold, over and gone. Did I tell you my Uncle
    arrived from Paris on Monday, as they hoped he would&mdash;so my travel
    would have been to great purpose!

</p>
<p>
    Your letter which should have reached me in the morning of yesterday,
    I did not receive until nearly midnight&mdash;partly through the
    eccentricity of our new postman whose good pleasure it is to make use
    of the letter-box without knocking; and partly from the confusion in
    the house, of illness in different ways ... the very servants being
    ill, ... one of them breaking a blood-vessel&mdash;for there is no new case
    of fever; ... and for dear Occy, he grows better slowly day by day.
    And just so late last night, five letters were found in the
    letter-box, and mine ... yours ... among them&mdash;which accounts for my
    beginning to answer it only now.
</p>
<p>
    What am I to say but this ... that I know what you are ... and that I
    know also what you are to <i>me</i>,&mdash;and that I should accept that
    knowledge as more than sufficient recompense for worse vexations than
    these late ones. Therefore let no more be said of them: and no more
    <i>need</i> be said, even if they were not likely to prove their own end
    good, as I believe with you. You may be quite sure that I shall be
    well this winter, if in any way it should be possible, and that I
    <i>will not</i> be beaten down, if the will can do anything. I admire how,
    if all had happened so but a year ago, (yet it could not have happened
    quite <i>so</i>!), I should certainly have been beaten down&mdash;and how it is
    different now, ... and how it is only gratitude to you, to <i>say</i> that
    it is different now. My cage is not worse but better since you brought
    the green groundsel to it&mdash;and to dash oneself against the wires of it
    will not open the door. We shall see ... and God will oversee. And in
    the meantime you will not talk of extravagances; and then nobody need
    hold up the hand&mdash;because, as I said and say, I am yours, your
    own&mdash;only not to <i>hurt you</i>. So now let us talk of the first of
    November and of the poems which are to come out then, and of the poems
    which are to come after then&mdash;and of the new avatar of 'Sordello,' for
    instance, which you taught me to look for. And let us both be busy and
    cheerful&mdash;and you will come and see me throughout the winter, ... if
    you do not decide rather on going abroad, which may be better ...
    better for your health's sake?&mdash;in which case I shall have your
    letters.
</p>
<p>
    And here is another ... just arrived. How I thank you. Think of the
    <i>Times</i>! Still it was very well of them to recognise your
    principality. Oh yes&mdash;do let me see the proof&mdash;I understand too about
    the 'making and spoiling.'
</p>
<p>
    Almost you forced me to smile by thinking it worth while to say that
    you are '<i>not selfish</i>.' Did Sir Percival say so to Sir Gawaine across
    the Round Table, in those times of chivalry to which you belong by the
    soul? Certainly you are not selfish! May God bless you.

    The fever may last, they say, for a week longer, or even a

<p>
    Do tell me what you mean precisely by your 'Bells and Pomegranates'
    title. I have always understood it to refer to the Hebraic priestly
    garment&mdash;but Mr. Kenyon held against me the other day that your
    reference was different, though he had not the remotest idea how. And
    yesterday I forgot to ask, for not the first time. Tell me too why you
    should not in the new number satisfy, by a note somewhere, the Davuses
    of the world who are in the majority ('Davi sumus, non Oedipi') with a
    solution of this one Sphinx riddle. Is there a reason against it?
</p>
<p>
    Occy continues to make progress&mdash;with a pulse at only eighty-four this
    morning. Are you learned in the pulse that I should talk as if you
    were? <i>I</i>, who have had my lessons? He takes scarcely anything yet but
    water, and his head is very hot still&mdash;but the progress is quite
    sure, though it may be a lingering case.
</p>
<p>
    Your beautiful flowers!&mdash;none the less beautiful for waiting for water
    yesterday. As fresh as ever, they were; and while I was putting them
    into the water, I thought that your visit went on all the time. Other
    thoughts too I had, which made me look down blindly, quite blindly, on
    the little blue flowers, ... while I thought what I could not have
    said an hour before without breaking into tears which would have run
    faster then. To say now that I never can forget; that I feel myself
    bound to you as one human being cannot be more bound to another;&mdash;and
    that you are more to me at this moment than all the rest of the world;
    is only to say in new words that it would be a wrong against <i>myself</i>,
    to seem to risk your happiness and abuse your generosity. For <i>me</i> ...
    though you threw out words yesterday about the testimony of a 'third
    person,' ... it would be monstrous to assume it to be necessary to
    vindicate my trust of you&mdash;<i>I trust you implicitly</i>&mdash;and am not too
    proud to owe all things to you. But now let us wait and see what this
    winter does or undoes&mdash;while God does His part for good, as we know. I
    will never fail to you from any human influence whatever&mdash;<i>that</i> I
    have promised&mdash;but you must let it be different from the other sort of
    promise which it would be a wrong to make. May God bless you&mdash;you,
    whose fault it is, to be too generous. You <i>are</i> not like other men,
    as I could see from the beginning&mdash;no.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I have the proof to-night, I ask myself.
</p>
<p>
    And if you like to come on Monday rather than Tuesday, I do not see
    why there should be a 'no' to that. Judge from your own convenience.
    Only we must be wise in the general practice, and abstain from too
    frequent meetings, for fear of difficulties. I am Cassandra you know,
    and smell the slaughter in the bath-room. It would make no difference
    in fact; but in comfort, much.

    I must not go on tearing these poor sheets one after the other,&mdash;the
    proper phrases <i>will not</i> come,&mdash;so let them stay, while you care for
    my best interests in their best, only way, and say for <i>me</i> what I

    I will make a note as you suggest&mdash;or, perhaps, keep it for the

    Pomegranates symbolical of Pleasure and Profit, the gay and the grave,
    the Poetry and the Prose, Singing and Sermonizing&mdash;such a mixture of
    effects as in the original hour (that is quarter of an hour) of
    confidence and creation. I meant the whole should prove at last. Well,
    it <i>has</i> succeeded beyond my most adventurous wishes in one
    respect&mdash;'Blessed eyes mine eyes have been, if&mdash;' if there was any
    sweetness in the tongue or flavour in the seeds to <i>her</i>. But I shall
    do quite other and better things, or shame on me! The proof has not

    probably I will.

    Even at the risk of teazing you a little I must say a few words, that
    there may be no misunderstanding between us&mdash;and this, before I sleep
    to-night. To-day and before to-day you surprised me by your manner of
    receiving my remark about your visits, for I believed I had
    sufficiently made clear to you long ago how certain questions were
    ordered in this house and how no exception was to be expected for my
    sake or even for yours. Surely I told you this quite plainly long ago.
    I only meant to say in my last letter, in the same track ... (fearing
    in the case of your wishing to come oftener that you might think it
    unkind in me not to seem to wish the same) ... that if you came too
    often and it was <i>observed</i>, difficulties and vexations would follow
    as a matter of course, and it would be wise therefore to run no risk.
    That was the head and front of what I meant to say. The weekly one
    visit is a thing established and may go on as long as you please&mdash;and
    there is no objection to your coming twice a week <i>now</i> and <i>then</i> ...
    if now and then merely ... if there is no habit ... do you understand?
    I may be prudent in an extreme perhaps&mdash;and certainly everybody in the
    house is not equally prudent!&mdash;but I did shrink from running any risk
    with that calm and comfort of the winter as it seemed to come on. And
    was it more than I said about the cloak? was there any newness in it?
    anything to startle you? Still I do perfectly see that whether new or
    old, what it <i>involves</i> may well be unpleasant to you&mdash;and that
    (however old) it may be apt to recur to your mind with a new
    increasing unpleasantness. We have both been carried too far perhaps,
    by late events and impulses&mdash;but it is never too late to come back to
    a right place, and I for my part come back to mine, and entreat you my
    dearest friend, first, <i>not to answer this</i>, and next, to weigh and
    consider thoroughly 'that particular contingency' which (I tell you
    plainly, I who know) the tongue of men and of angels would not modify
    so as to render less full of vexations to you. Let Pisa prove the
    excellent hardness of some marbles! Judge. From motives of
    self-respect, you may well walk an opposite way ... <i>you</i>.... When I
    told you once ... or twice ... that 'no human influence should' &amp;c.
    &amp;c., ... I spoke for myself, quite over-looking you&mdash;and now that I
    turn and see you, I am surprised that I did not see you before ...
    <i>there</i>. I ask you therefore to consider 'that contingency' well&mdash;not
    forgetting the other obvious evils, which the late decision about Pisa
    has aggravated beyond calculation ... for as the smoke rolls off we
    see the harm done by the fire. And so, and now ... is it not advisable
    for you to go abroad at once ... as you always intended, you know ...
    now that your book is through the press? What if you go next week? I
    leave it to you. In any case <i>I entreat you not to answer
    this</i>&mdash;neither let your thoughts be too hard on me for what you may
    call perhaps vacillation&mdash;only that I stand excused (I do not say
    justified) before my own moral sense. May God bless you. If you go, I
    shall wait to see you till your return, and have letters in the
    meantime. I write all this as fast as I can to have it over. What I
    ask of you is, to consider alone and decide advisedly ... for both our
    sakes. If it should be your choice not to make an end now, ... why I
    shall understand <i>that</i> by your not going ... or you may say '<i>no</i>' in
    a word ... for I require no '<i>protestations</i>' indeed&mdash;and <i>you</i> may
    trust to <i>me</i> ... it shall be as you choose. <i>You will consider my
    happiness most by considering your own</i> ... and that is my last word.

    <i>Wednesday morning.</i>&mdash;I did not say half I thought about the poems
    yesterday&mdash;and their various power and beauty will be striking and
    surprising to your most accustomed readers. 'St. Praxed'&mdash;'Pictor
    Ignotus'&mdash;'The Ride'&mdash;'The Duchess'!&mdash;Of the new poems I like
    supremely the first and last ... that 'Lost Leader' which strikes so
    broadly and deep ... which nobody can ever forget&mdash;and which is worth
    all the journalizing and pamphleteering in the world!&mdash;and then, the
    last 'Thought' which is quite to be grudged to that place of fragments
    ... those grand sea-sights in the long lines. Should not these
    fragments be severed otherwise than by numbers? The last stanza but
    one of the 'Lost Mistress' seemed obscure to me. Is it so really? The
    end you have put to 'England in Italy' gives unity to the whole ...
    just what the poem wanted. Also you have given some nobler lines to
    the middle than met me there before. 'The Duchess' appears to me more
    than ever a new-minted golden coin&mdash;the rhythm of it answering to your
    own description, 'Speech half asleep, or song half awake?' You have
    right of trove to these novel effects of rhythm. Now if people do not
    cry out about these poems, what are we to think of the world?

<p>
    But I <i>must</i> answer you, and be forgiven, too, dearest. I was (to
    begin at the beginning) surely not '<i>startled</i>' ... only properly
    aware of the deep blessing I have been enjoying this while, and not
    disposed to take its continuance as pure matter of course, and so
    treat with indifference the first shadow of a threatening intimation
    from without, the first hint of a possible abstraction from the
    quarter to which so many hopes and fears of mine have gone of late. In
    this case, knowing you, I was sure that if any imaginable form of
    displeasure could touch you without reaching me, I should not hear of
    it too soon&mdash;so I spoke&mdash;so <i>you</i> have spoken&mdash;and so now you get
    'excused'? No&mdash;wondered at, with all my faculty of wonder for the
    strange exalting way you will persist to think of me; now, once for
    all, I <i>will</i> not pass for what I make no least pretence to. I quite
    understand the grace of your imaginary self-denial, and fidelity to a
    given word, and noble constancy; but it all happens to be none of
    mine, none in the least. I love you because I <i>love</i> you; I see you
    'once a week' because I cannot see you all day long; I think of you
    all day long, because I most certainly could not think of you once an
    hour less, if I tried, or went to Pisa, or 'abroad' (in every sense)
    in order to 'be happy' ... a kind of adventure which you seem to
    suppose you have in some way interfered with. Do, for this once,
    think, and never after, on the impossibility of your ever (you know I
    must talk your own language, so I shall say&mdash;) hindering any scheme of
    mine, stopping any supposable advancement of mine. Do you really think
    that before I found you, I was going about the world seeking whom I
    might devour, that is, be devoured by, in the shape of a wife ... do
    you suppose I ever dreamed of marrying? What would it mean for me,
    with my life I am hardened in&mdash;considering the rational chances; how
    the land is used to furnish its contingent of Shakespeare's women: or
    by 'success,' 'happiness' &amp;c. &amp;c. you never never can be seeing for a
    moment with the world's eyes and meaning 'getting rich' and all that?
    Yet, put that away, and what do you meet at every turn, if you are
    hunting about in the dusk to catch my good, but yourself?
</p>
<p>
    <i>I</i> know who has got it, caught it, and means to keep it on his
    heart&mdash;the person most concerned&mdash;<i>I</i>, dearest, who cannot play the
    disinterested part of bidding <i>you</i> forget your 'protestation' ...
    what should I have to hold by, come what will, through years, through
    this life, if God shall so determine, if I were not sure, <i>sure</i> that
    the first moment when you can suffer me with you 'in that relation,'
    you will remember and act accordingly. I will, as you know, conform my
    life to <i>any</i> imaginable rule which shall render it possible for your
    life to move with it and possess it, all the little it is worth.
</p>
<p>
    For your friends ... whatever can be 'got over,' whatever opposition
    may be rational, will be easily removed, I suppose. You know when I
    spoke lately about the 'selfishness' I dared believe I was free from,
    I hardly meant the low faults of ... I shall say, a different
    organization to mine&mdash;which has vices in plenty, but not those.
    Besides half a dozen scratches with a pen make one stand up an
    apparent angel of light, from the lawyer's parchment; and Doctors'
    Commons is one bland smile of applause. The selfishness I deprecate is
    one which a good many women, and men too, call 'real passion'&mdash;under
    the influence of which, I ought to say 'be mine, what ever happens to
    <i>you</i>'&mdash;but I know better, and you know best&mdash;and you know me, for all
    this letter, which is no doubt in me, I feel, but dear entire goodness
    and affection, of which God knows whether I am proud or not&mdash;and now
    you will let me be, will not you. Let me have my way, live my life,
    love my love.

    I wrote briefly yesterday not to make my letter longer by keeping it;
    and a few last words which belong to it by right, must follow after it
    ... must&mdash;for I want to say that you need not indeed talk to me about
    squares being not round, and of <i>you</i> being not 'selfish'! You know it
    is foolish to talk such superfluities, and not a compliment.
</p>
<p>
    I won't say to my knowledge of you and faith in you ... but to my
    understanding generally. Why should you say to me at all ... much
    less for this third or fourth time ... 'I am not selfish?' to <i>me</i> who
    never ... when I have been deepest asleep and dreaming, ... never
    dreamed of attributing to you any form of such a fault? Promise not to
    say so again&mdash;now promise. Think how it must sound to my ears, when
    really and truly I have sometimes felt jealous of myself ... of my own
    infirmities, ... and thought that you cared for me only because your
    chivalry touched them with a silver sound&mdash;and that, without them, you
    would pass by on the other side:&mdash;why twenty times I have thought
    <i>that</i> and been vexed&mdash;ungrateful vexation! In exchange for which too
    frank confession, I will ask for another silent promise ... a silent
    promise&mdash;no, but first I will say another thing.
</p>
<p>
    First I will say that you are not to fancy any the least danger of my
    falling under displeasure through your visits&mdash;there is no sort of
    risk of it <i>for the present</i>&mdash;and if I ran the risk of making you
    uncomfortable about <i>that</i>, I did foolishly, and what I meant to do
    was different. I wish you also to understand that <i>even if you came
    here every day</i>, my brothers and sisters would simply care to know if
    I liked it, and then be glad if I was glad:&mdash;the caution referred to
    one person alone. In relation to <i>whom</i>, however, there will be no
    'getting over'&mdash;you might as well think to sweep off a third of the
    stars of Heaven with the motion of your eyelashes&mdash;this, for matter of
    fact and certainty&mdash;and this, as I said before, the keeping of a
    general rule and from no disrespect towards individuals: a great
    peculiarity <i>in the individual</i> of course. But ... though I have been
    a submissive daughter, and this from no effort, but for love's sake
    ... because I loved him tenderly (and love him), ... and hoped that he
    loved me back again even if the proofs came untenderly sometimes&mdash;yet
    I have reserved for myself <i>always</i> that right over my own affections
    which is the most strictly personal of all things, and which involves
    principles and consequences of infinite importance and scope&mdash;even
    though I <i>never</i> thought (except perhaps when the door of life was
    just about to open ... before it opened) never thought it probable or
    possible that I should have occasion for the exercise; from without
    and from within at once. I have too much need to look up. For friends,
    I can look any way ... round, and <i>down</i> even&mdash;the merest thread of a
    sympathy will draw me sometimes&mdash;or even the least look of kind eyes
    over a dyspathy&mdash;'Cela se peut facilement.' But for another
    relation&mdash;it was all different&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;and so very
    different&mdash;'Cela ne se peut nullement'&mdash;as in Malherbe.
</p>
<p>
    And now we must agree to 'let all this be,', and set ourselves to get
    as much good and enjoyment from the coming winter (better spent at
    Pisa!) as we can&mdash;and I begin my joy by being glad that you are not
    going since I am not going, and by being proud of these new green
    leaves in your bay which came out with the new number. And then will
    come the tragedies&mdash;and then, ... what beside? We shall have a happy
    winter after all ... <i>I</i> shall at least; and if Pisa had been better,
    London might be worse: and for <i>me</i> to grow pretentious and fastidious
    and critical about various sorts of <i>purple</i> ... I, who have been used
    to the <i>brun foncé</i> of Mme. de Sévigné, (<i>foncé</i> and <i>enfoncé</i>
    ...)&mdash;would be too absurd. But why does not the proof come all this
    time? I have kept this letter to go back with it.
</p>
<p>
    I had a proposition from the New York booksellers about six weeks ago
    (the booksellers who printed the poems) to let them re-print those
    prose papers of mine in the <i>Athenæum</i>, with additional matter on
    American literature, in a volume by itself&mdash;to be published at the
    same time both in America and England by Wiley and Putnam in Waterloo
    Place, and meaning to offer liberal terms, they said. Now what shall I
    do? Those papers are not fit for separate publication, and I am not
    inclined to the responsibility of them; and in any case, they must
    give as much trouble as if they were re-written (trouble and not
    poetry!), before I could consent to such a thing. Well!&mdash;and if I do
    not ... these people are just as likely to print them without leave
    ... and so without correction. What do you advise? What shall I do?
    All this time they think me sublimely indifferent, they who pressed
    for an answer by return of packet&mdash;and now it is past six ... eight
    weeks; and I must say something.
</p>
<p>
    Am I not 'femme qui parle' to-day? And let me talk on ever so, the
    proof won't come. May God bless you&mdash;and me as I am
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    And the silent promise I would have you make is this&mdash;that if ever you
    should leave me, it shall be (though you are not 'selfish') for your
    sake&mdash;and not for mine: for your good, and not for mine. I ask it&mdash;not
    because I am disinterested; but because one class of motives would be
    valid, and the other void&mdash;simply for that reason.
</p>
<p>
    Then the <i>femme qui parle</i> (looking back over the parlance) did not
    mean to say on the first page of this letter that she was ever for a
    moment <i>vexed in her pride</i> that she should owe anything to her
    adversities. It was only because adversities are accidents and not
    essentials. If it had been prosperities, it would have been the same
    thing&mdash;no, not the same thing!&mdash;but far worse.

    How does one make 'silent promises' ... or, rather, how does the maker
    of them communicate that fact to whomsoever it may concern? I know,
    there have been many, very many unutterable vows and promises
    made,&mdash;that is, <i>thought</i> down upon&mdash;the white slip at the top of my
    notes,&mdash;such as of this note; and not trusted to the pen, that always
    comes in for the shame,&mdash;but given up, and replaced by the poor forms
    to which a pen is equal; and a glad minute I should account <i>that</i>, in
    which you collected and accepted <i>those</i> 'promises'&mdash;because they
    would not be all so unworthy of me&mdash;much less you! I would receive, in
    virtue of <i>them</i>, the ascription of whatever worthiness is supposed to
    lie in deep, truest love, and gratitude&mdash;
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Read my silent answer there too!
</p>
<p>
    All your letter is one comfort: we will be happy this winter, and
    after, do not fear. I am most happy, to begin, that your brother is so
    much better: he must be weak and susceptible of cold, remember.
</p>
<p>
    It was on my lip, I do think, <i>last</i> visit, or the last but one, to
    beg you to detach those papers from the <i>Athenæum's gâchis</i>. Certainly
    this opportunity is <i>most</i> favourable, for every reason: you cannot
    hesitate, surely. At present those papers are lost&mdash;<i>lost</i> for
    practical purposes. Do pray reply without fail to the proposers; no,
    no harm of these really fine fellows, who <i>could</i> do harm (by printing
    incorrect copies, and perhaps eking out the column by suppositious
    matter ... ex-gr. they strengthened and lengthened a book of Dickens',
    in Paris, by adding quant. suff. of Thackeray's 'Yellowplush Papers'
    ... as I discovered by a Parisian somebody praising the latter to me
    as Dickens' best work!)&mdash;and who <i>do</i> really a good straightforward
    un-American thing. You will encourage 'the day of small
    things'&mdash;though this is not small, nor likely to have small results. I
    shall be impatient to hear that you have decided. I like the progress
    of these Americans in taste, their amazing leaps, like grasshoppers up
    to the sun&mdash;from ... what is the '<i>from</i>,' what depth, do you
    remember, say, ten or twelve years back?&mdash;<i>to</i>&mdash;Carlyle, and Tennyson,
    and you! So children leave off Jack of Cornwall and go on just to
    Homer.
</p>
<p>
    I can't conceive why my proof does not come&mdash;I must go to-morrow and
    see. In the other, I have corrected all the points you noted, to their
    evident improvement. Yesterday I took out 'Luria' and read it
    through&mdash;the skeleton&mdash;I shall hope to finish it soon now. It is for a
    purely imaginary stage,&mdash;very simple and straightforward. Would you
    ... no, Act by Act, as I was about to propose that you should read it;
    that process would affect the oneness I most wish to preserve.

    I write in haste, not to lose time about the proof. You will see on
    the papers here my doubtfulnesses such as they are&mdash;but silence
    swallows up the admirations ... and there is no time. 'Theocrite'
    overtakes that wish of mine which ran on so fast&mdash;and the 'Duchess'
    grows and grows the more I look&mdash;and 'Saul' is noble and must have his
    full royalty some day. Would it not be well, by the way, to print it
    in the meanwhile as a fragment confessed ... sowing asterisks at the
    end. Because as a poem of yours it stands there and wants unity, and
    people can't be expected to understand the difference between
    incompleteness and defect, unless you make a sign. For the new
    poems&mdash;they are full of beauty. You throw largesses out on all sides
    without counting the coins: how beautiful that 'Night and Morning' ...
    and the 'Earth's Immortalities' ... and the 'Song' too. And for your
    'Glove,' all women should be grateful,&mdash;and Ronsard, honoured, in
    this fresh shower of music on his old grave ... though the chivalry of
    the interpretation, as well as much beside, is so plainly yours, ...
    could only be yours perhaps. And even <i>you</i> are forced to let in a
    third person ... close to the doorway ... before you can do any good.
    What a noble lion you give us too, with the 'flash on his forehead,'
    and 'leagues in the desert already' as we look on him! And then, with
    what a 'curious felicity' you turn the subject 'glove' to another use
    and strike De Lorge's blow back on him with it, in the last paragraph
    of your story! And the versification! And the lady's speech&mdash;(to
    return!) so calm, and proud&mdash;yet a little bitter!
</p>
<p>
    Am I not to thank you for all the pleasure and pride in these poems?
    while you stand by and try to talk them down, perhaps.
</p>

    Tell me how your mother is&mdash;tell me how you are ... you who never were

    Like your kindness&mdash;too, far too generous kindness,&mdash;all this trouble
    and correcting,&mdash;and it is my proper office now, by this time, to sit
    still and receive, by right <i>Human</i> (as opposed to Divine). When you
    see the pamphlet's self, you will find your own doing,&mdash;but where will
    you find the proofs of the best of all helping and counselling and
    inciting, unless in new works which shall justify the
    <i>unsatisfaction</i>, if I may not say shame, at these, these written
    before your time, my best love?
</p>
<p>
    Are you doing well to-day? For I feel well, have walked some eight or
    nine miles&mdash;and my mother is very much better ... is singularly
    better. You know whether you rejoiced me or no by that information
    about the exercise <i>you</i> had taken yesterday. Think what telling one
    that you grow stronger would mean!
</p>
<p>
    'Vexatious' with you! Ah, prudence is all very right, and one ought,
    no doubt, to say, 'of course, we shall not expect a life exempt from
    the usual proportion of &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;' but truth is still more right, and
    includes the highest prudence besides, and I do believe that we shall
    be happy; that is, that <i>you</i> will be happy: you see I dare
    confidently expect <i>the</i> end to it all ... so it has always been with
    me in my life of wonders&mdash;absolute wonders, with God's hand over
    all.... And this last and best of all would never have begun so, and
    gone on so, to break off abruptly even here, in this world, for the
    little time.
</p>
<p>
    So try, try, dearest, every method, take every measure of hastening
    such a consummation. Why, we shall see Italy together! I could, would,
    <i>will</i> shut myself in four walls of a room with you and never leave
    you and be most of all <i>then</i> 'a lord of infinite space'&mdash;but, to
    travel with you to Italy, or Greece. Very vain, I know that, all such
    day dreaming! And ungrateful, too; with the real sufficing happiness
    here of being, and knowing that you know me to be, and suffer me to
    tell you I am yours, ever your own.

<p>
    All to-day, Friday, Miss Mitford has been here! She came at two and
    went away at seven&mdash;and I feel as if I had been making a five-hour
    speech on the corn laws in Harriet Martineau's parliament; ... so
    tired I am. Not that dear Miss Mitford did not talk both for me and
    herself, ... for that, of course she did. But I was forced to answer
    once every ten minutes at least&mdash;and Flush, my usual companion, does
    not exact so much&mdash;and so I am tired and come to rest myself on this
    paper. Your name was not once spoken to-day; a little from my good
    fencing: when I saw you at the end of an alley of associations, I
    pushed the conversation up the next&mdash;because I was afraid of questions
    such as every moment I expected, with a pair of woman's eyes behind
    them; and those are worse than Mr. Kenyon's, when he puts on his
    spectacles. So your name was not once spoken&mdash;not thought of, I do not
    say&mdash;perhaps when I once lost her at Chevy Chase and found her
    suddenly with Isidore the queen's hairdresser, my thoughts might have
    wandered off to you and your unanswered letter while she passed
    gradually from that to this&mdash;I am not sure of the contrary. And
    Isidore, they say, reads Béranger, and is supposed to be the most
    literary person at court&mdash;and wasn't at Chevy Chase one must needs
    think.
</p>
<p>
    One must needs write nonsense rather&mdash;for I have written it there. The
    sense and the truth is, that your letter went to the bottom of my
    heart, and that my thoughts have turned round it ever since and
    through all the talking to-day. Yes indeed, dreams! But what <i>is</i> not
    dreaming is this and this&mdash;this reading of these words&mdash;this proof of
    this regard&mdash;all this that you are to me in fact, and which you cannot
    guess the full meaning of, dramatic poet as you are ... cannot ...
    since you do not know what my life meant before you touched it, ...
    and my angel at the gate of the prison! My wonder is greater than your
    wonders, ... I who sate here alone but yesterday, so weary of my own
    being that to take interest in my very poems I had to lift them up by
    an effort and separate them from myself and cast them out from me into
    the sunshine where I was not&mdash;feeling nothing of the light which fell
    on them even&mdash;making indeed a sort of pleasure and interest about that
    factitious personality associated with them ... but knowing it to be
    all far on the outside of <i>me</i> ... <i>myself</i> ... not seeming to touch
    it with the end of my finger ... and receiving it as a mockery and a
    bitterness when people persisted in confounding one with another.
    Morbid it was if you like it&mdash;perhaps very morbid&mdash;but all these heaps
    of letters which go into the fire one after the other, and which,
    because I am a woman and have written verses, it seems so amusing to
    the letter-writers of your sex to write and see 'what will come of
    it,' ... some, from kind good motives I know, ... well, ... how could
    it all make for me even such a narrow strip of sunshine as Flush finds
    on the floor sometimes, and lays his nose along, with both ears out in
    the shadow? It was not for <i>me</i> ... <i>me</i> ... in any way: it was not
    within my reach&mdash;I did not seem to touch it as I said. Flush came
    nearer, and I was grateful to him ... yes, grateful ... for not being
    tired! I have felt grateful and flattered ... yes flattered ... when
    he has chosen rather to stay with me all day than go down-stairs.
    Grateful too, with reason, I have been and am to my own family for not
    letting me see that I was a burthen. These are facts. And now how am I
    to feel when you tell me what you have told me&mdash;and what you 'could
    would and will' do, and <i>shall not</i> do?... but when you tell me?
</p>
<p>
    Only remember that such words make you freer and freer&mdash;if you can be
    freer than free&mdash;just as every one makes me happier and richer&mdash;too
    rich by you, to claim any debt. May God bless you always. When I wrote
    that letter to let you come the first time, do you know, the tears ran
    down my cheeks.... I could not tell why: partly it might be mere
    nervousness. And then, I was vexed with you for wishing to come as
    other people did, and vexed with myself for not being able to refuse
    you as I did them.
</p>
<p>
    When does the book come out? Not on the first, I begin to be glad.

    I had your note last night, and am waiting for the book to-day; a true
    living breathing book, let the writer say of it what he will. Also
    when it comes it won't certainly come 'sine te.' Which is my comfort.
</p>
<p>
    And now&mdash;not to make any more fuss about a matter of simple
    restitution&mdash;may I have my letter back?... I mean the letter which if
    you did not destroy ... did not punish for its sins long and long ago
    ... belongs to me&mdash;which, if destroyed, I must lose for my sins, ...
    but, if undestroyed, which I may have back; may I not? is it not my
    own? must I not?&mdash;that letter I was made to return and now turn to ask
    for again in further expiation. Now do I ask humbly enough? And send
    it at once, if undestroyed&mdash;do not wait till Saturday.
</p>
<p>
    I have considered about Mr. Kenyon and it seems best, in the event of
    a question or of a remark equivalent to a question, to confess to the
    visits 'generally once a week' ... because he may hear, one, two,
    three different ways, ... not to say the other reasons and Chaucer's
    charge against 'doubleness.' I fear ... I fear that he (not Chaucer)
    will wonder a little&mdash;and he has looked at me with scanning spectacles
    already and talked of its being a mystery to him how you made your way
    here; and <i>I</i>, who though I can <i>bespeak</i> self-command, have no sort
    of presence of mind (not so much as one would use to play at Jack
    straws) did not help the case at all. Well&mdash;it cannot be helped. Did I
    ever tell you what he said of you once&mdash;'<i>that you deserved to be a
    poet</i>&mdash;being one in your heart and life:' he said <i>that</i> of you to me,
    and I thought it a noble encomium and deserving its application.
</p>
<p>
    For the rest ... yes: you know I do&mdash;God knows I do. Whatever I can
    feel is for you&mdash;and perhaps it is not less, for not being simmered
    away in too much sunshine as with women accounted happier. <i>I</i> am

<p>
    I see and know; read and mark; and only hope there is no harm done by
    my meddling; and lose the sense of it all in the sense of beauty and
    power everywhere, which nobody could kill, if they took to meddling
    more even. And now, what will people say to this and this and this&mdash;or
    'O seclum insipiens et inficetum!' or rather, O ungrateful right hand
    which does not thank you first! I do thank you. I have been reading
    everything with new delight; and at intervals remembering in
    inglorious complacency (for which you must try to forgive me) that Mr.
    Forster is no longer anything like an enemy. And yet (just see what
    contradiction!) the <i>British Quarterly</i> has been abusing me so at
    large, that I can only take it to be the achievement of a very
    particular friend indeed,&mdash;of someone who positively never reviewed
    before and tries his new sword on me out of pure friendship. Only I
    suppose it is not the general rule, and that there are friends 'with a
    difference.' Not that you are to fancy me pained&mdash;oh no!&mdash;merely
    surprised. I was prepared for anything almost from the quarter in
    question, but scarcely for being hung 'to the crows' so publicly ...
    though within the bounds of legitimate criticisms, mind. But oh&mdash;the
    creatures of your sex are not always magnanimous&mdash;<i>that</i> is true. And
    to put <i>you</i> between me and all ... the thought of <i>you</i> ... in a
    great eclipse of the world ... <i>that</i> is happy ... only, too happy for
    such as I am; as my own heart warns me hour by hour.
</p>
<p>
    'Serve <i>me</i> right'&mdash;I do not dare to complain. I wished for the safety
    of that letter so much that I finished by persuading myself of the
    probability of it: but 'serve <i>me</i> right' quite clearly. And yet&mdash;but
    no more 'and yets' about it. 'And yets' fray the silk.
</p>
<p>
    I see how the 'turret' stands in the new reading, triumphing over the
    'tower,' and unexceptionable in every respect. Also I do hold that
    nobody with an ordinary understanding has the slightest pretence for
    attaching a charge of obscurity to this new number&mdash;there are lights
    enough for the critics to scan one another's dull blank of visage by.
    One verse indeed in that expressive lyric of the 'Lost Mistress,' does
    still seem questionable to me, though you have changed a word since I
    saw it; and still I fancy that I rather leap at the meaning than reach
    it&mdash;but it is my own fault probably ... I am not sure. With that one
    exception I <i>am quite</i> sure that people who shall complain of darkness
    are blind ... I mean, that the construction is clear and unembarrassed
    everywhere. Subtleties of thought which are not directly apprehensible
    by minds of a common range, are here as elsewhere in your
    writings&mdash;but if to utter things 'hard to understand' from <i>that</i>
    cause be an offence, why we may begin with 'our beloved brother Paul,'
    you know, and go down through all the geniuses of the world, and bid
    them put away their inspirations. You must descend to the level of
    critic A or B, that he may look into your face.... Ah well!&mdash;'Let them
    rave.' You will live when all <i>those</i> are under the willows. In the
    meantime there is something better, as you said, even than your
    poetry&mdash;as the giver is better than the gift, and the maker than the
    creature, and <i>you</i> than <i>yours</i>. Yes&mdash;<i>you</i> than <i>yours</i>.... (I did
    not mean it so when I wrote it first ... but I accept the 'bona
    verba,' and use the phrase for the end of my letter) ... as <i>you</i> are
    better than <i>yours</i>; even when so much yours as your own

    There is no reason against Saturday so far. Mr. Kenyon comes

</p>
<p>
    When I come back from seeing you, and think over it all, there never
    is a least word of yours I could not occupy myself with, and wish to
    return to you with some ... not to say, all ... the thoughts and
    fancies it is sure to call out of me. There is nothing in you that
    does not draw out all of me. You possess me, dearest ... and there is
    no help for the expressing it all, no voice nor hand, but these of
    mine which shrink and turn away from the attempt. So you must go on,
    patiently, knowing me more and more, and your entire power on me, and
    I will console myself, to the full extent, with your
    knowledge&mdash;penetration, intuition&mdash;<i>somehow</i> I must believe you can
    get to what is here, in me, without the pretence of my telling or
    writing it. But, because I give up the great achievements, there is no
    reason I should not secure any occasion of making clear one of the
    less important points that arise in our intercourse ... if I fancy I
    can do it with the least success. For instance, it is on my mind to
    explain what I meant yesterday by trusting that the entire happiness I
    feel in the letters, and the help in the criticising might not be hurt
    by the surmise, even, that those labours to which you were born, might
    be suspended, in any degree, through such generosity to <i>me</i>. Dearest,
    I believed in your glorious genius and knew it for a true star from
    the moment I saw it; long before I had the blessing of knowing it was
    <SPAN class="sc-ex">my</span> star, with my fortune and futurity in it. And, when I draw back
    from myself, and look better and more clearly, then I <i>do</i> feel, with
    you, that the writing a few letters more or less, reading many or few
    rhymes of any other person, would not interfere in any material degree
    with that power of yours&mdash;that you might easily make one so happy and
    yet go on writing 'Geraldines' and 'Berthas'&mdash;but&mdash;how can I, dearest,
    leave my heart's treasures long, even to look at your genius?... and
    when I come back and find all safe, find the comfort of you, the
    traces of you ... <i>will</i> it do&mdash;tell me&mdash;to trust all that as a light
    effort, an easy matter?
</p>
<p>
    Yet, if you can lift me with one hand, while the other suffices to
    crown you&mdash;there is queenliness in <i>that</i>, too!
</p>
<p>
    Well, I have spoken. As I told you, your turn comes now. How have you
    determined respecting the American Edition? You tell me nothing of
    yourself! It is all <SPAN class="sc-ex">me</span> you help, me you do good to ... and I take it
    all! Now see, if this goes on! I have not had <i>every</i> love-luxury, I
    now find out ... where is the proper, rationally
    to-be-expected&mdash;'<i>lovers' quarrel</i>'? <i>Here</i>, as you will find! 'Iræ;
    amantium'.... I am no more 'at a loss with my Naso,' than Peter
    Ronsard. Ah, but then they are to be <i>reintegratio amoris</i>&mdash;and to get
    back into a thing, one must needs get for a moment first out of it ...
    trust me, no! And now, the natural inference from all this? The
    consistent inference ... the 'self-denying ordinance'? Why&mdash;do you
    doubt? even this,&mdash;you must just put aside the Romance, and tell the
    Americans to wait, and make my heart start up when the letter is laid
    to it; the letter full of your news, telling me you are well and
    walking, and working for my sake towards <i>the time</i>&mdash;informing me,
    moreover, if Thursday or Friday is to be my day&mdash;.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you, my own love.
</p>
<p>
    I will certainly bring you an Act of the Play ... for this serpent's
    reason, in addition to the others ... that&mdash;No, I will <i>tell</i> you
    that&mdash;I can tell you now more than even lately!

<p>
    If it were possible that you could do me harm in the way of work, (but
    it isn't) it would be possible, not through writing letters and
    reading manuscripts, but because of a reason to be drawn from your own
    great line
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">What man is strong until he stands alone?
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">What man ... what woman? For have I not felt twenty times the desolate
    advantage of being insulated here and of not minding anybody when I
    made my poems?&mdash;of living a little like a disembodied spirit, and
    caring less for suppositious criticism than for the black fly buzzing
    in the pane?&mdash;<i>That</i> made me what dear Mr. Kenyon calls
    'insolent,'&mdash;untimid, and unconventional in my degree; and not so much
    by strength, you see, as by separation. <i>You</i> touch your greater ends
    by mere strength; breaking with your own hands the hampering threads
    which, in your position would have hampered <i>me</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Still ... when all is changed for me now, and different, it is not
    possible, ... for all the changing, nor for all your line and my
    speculation, ... that I should not be better and stronger for being
    within your influences and sympathies, in this way of writing as in
    other ways. We shall see&mdash;you will see. Yet I have been idle lately I
    confess; leaning half out of some turret-window of the castle of
    Indolence and watching the new sunrise&mdash;as why not?&mdash;Do I mean to be
    idle always?&mdash;no!&mdash;and am I not an industrious worker on the average
    of days? Indeed yes! Also I have been less idle than you think
    perhaps, even this last year, though the results seem so like
    trifling: and I shall set about the prose papers for the New York
    people, and the something rather better besides we may hope ... may
    <i>I</i> not hope, if <i>you</i> wish it? Only there is no 'crown' for me, be
    sure, except what grows from this letter and such letters ... this
    sense of being anything to <i>one</i>! there is no room for another crown.
    Have I a great head like Goethe's that there should be room? and mine
    is bent down already by the unused weight&mdash;and as to bearing it, ...
    'Will it do,&mdash;tell me; to treat <i>that</i> as a light effort, an easy
    matter?'
</p>
<p>
    Now let me remember to tell you that the line of yours I have just
    quoted, and which has been present with me since you wrote it, Mr.
    Chorley has quoted too in his new novel of 'Pomfret.' You were right
    in your identifying of servant and waistcoat&mdash;and Wilson waited only
    till you had gone on Saturday, to give me a parcel and note; the novel
    itself in fact, which Mr. Chorley had the kindness to send me 'some
    days or weeks,' said the note, 'previous to the publication.' Very
    goodnatured of him certainly: and the book seems to me his best work
    in point of sustainment and vigour, and I am in process of being
    interested in it. Not that he is a <i>maker</i>, even for this prose. A
    feeler ... an observer ... a thinker even, in a certain sphere&mdash;but a
    maker ... no, as it seems to me&mdash;and if I were he, I would rather herd
    with the essayists than the novelists where he is too good to take
    inferior rank and not strong enough to 'go up higher.' Only it would
    be more right in me to be grateful than to talk so&mdash;now wouldn't it?
</p>
<p>
    And here is Mr. Kenyon's letter back again&mdash;a kind good letter ... a
    letter I have liked to read (so it was kind and good in you to let
    me!)&mdash;and he was with me to-day and praising the 'Ride to Ghent,' and
    praising the 'Duchess,' and praising you altogether as I liked to hear
    him. The Ghent-ride was 'very fine'&mdash;and the
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Into the midnight they galloped abreast
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">drew us out into the night as witnesses. And then, the 'Duchess' ...
    the conception of it was noble, and the vehicle, rhythm and all, most
    characteristic and individual ... though some of the rhymes ... oh,
    some of the rhymes did not find grace in his ears&mdash;but the
    incantation-scene, 'just trenching on the supernatural,' <i>that</i> was
    taken to be 'wonderful,' ... 'showing extraordinary power, ... as
    indeed other things did ... works of a highly original writer and of
    such various faculty!'&mdash;Am I not tired of writing your praises as he
    said then? So I shall tell you, instead of any more, that I went down
    to the drawing-room yesterday (because it was warm enough) by an act
    of supererogatory virtue for which you may praise <i>me</i> in turn. What
    weather it is! and how the year seems to have forgotten itself into
    April.
</p>
<p>
    But after all, how have I answered your letter? and how <i>are</i> such
    letters to be answered? Do we answer the sun when he shines? May God
    bless you ... it is my answer&mdash;with one word besides ... that I am
    wholly and ever your
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    On Thursday as far as I know yet&mdash;and you shall hear if there should
    be an obstacle. <i>Will you walk?</i> If you will not, you know, you must
    be forgetting me a little. Will you remember me too in the act of the
    play?&mdash;but above all things in taking the right exercise, and in not
    overworking the head. And this for no serpent's reason.
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Two letters in one&mdash;Wednesday.<br>
[Post-mark, November 15, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    I shall see you to-morrow and yet am writing what you will have to
    read perhaps. When you spoke of 'stars' and 'geniuses' in that letter,
    I did not seem to hear; I was listening to those words of the letter
    which were of a better silver in the sound than even your praise could
    be; and now that at last I come to hear them in their extravagance (oh
    such pure extravagance about 'glorious geniuses'&mdash;) I can't help
    telling you they were heard last, and deserved it.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I tell you besides?&mdash;The first moment in which I seemed to admit
    to myself in a flash of lightning the <i>possibility</i> of your affection
    for me being more than dream-work ... the first moment was <i>that</i> when
    you intimated (as you have done since repeatedly) that you cared for
    me not for a reason, but because you cared for me. Now such a
    'parceque' which reasonable people would take to be irrational, was
    just the only one fitted to the uses of my understanding on the
    particular question we were upon ... just the 'woman's reason'
    suitable to the woman ...; for I could understand that it might be as
    you said, and, if so, that it was altogether unanswerable ... do you
    see? If a fact includes its own cause ... why there it stands for
    ever&mdash;one of 'earth's immortalities'&mdash;<i>as long as it includes it</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And when unreasonableness stands for a reason, it is a promising state
    of things, we may both admit, and proves what it would be as well not
    too curiously to enquire into. But then ... to look at it in a
    brighter aspect, ... I do remember how, years ago, when talking the
    foolishnesses which women will talk when they are by themselves, and
    not forced to be sensible, ... one of my friends thought it 'safest to
    begin with a little aversion,' and another, wisest to begin with a
    great deal of esteem, and how the best attachments were produced so
    and so, ... I took it into my head to say that the best was where
    there was no cause at all for it, and the more wholly unreasonable,
    the better still; that the motive should lie in the feeling itself and
    not in the object of it&mdash;and that the affection which could (if it
    could) throw itself out on an idiot with a goître would be more
    admirable than Abelard's. Whereupon everybody laughed, and someone
    thought it affected of me and no true opinion, and others said plainly
    that it was immoral, and somebody else hoped, in a sarcasm, that I
    meant to act out my theory for the advantage of the world. To which I
    replied quite gravely that I had not virtue enough&mdash;and so, people
    laughed as it is fair to laugh when other people are esteemed to talk
    nonsense. And all this came back to me in the south wind of your
    'parceque,' and I tell it as it came ... now.
</p>
<p>
    Which proves, if it proves anything, ... while I have every sort of
    natural pleasure in your praises and like you to like my poetry just
    as I should, and perhaps more than I should; yet <i>why</i> it is all
    behind ... and in its place&mdash;and <i>why</i> I have a tendency moreover to
    sift and measure any praise of yours and to separate it from the
    superfluities, far more than with any other person's praise in the
    world.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Friday evening.</i>&mdash;Shall I send this letter or not? I have been 'tra
    'l si e 'l no,' and writing a new beginning on a new sheet even&mdash;but
    after all you ought to hear the remote echo of your last letter ...
    far out among the hills, ... as well as the immediate reverberation,
    and so I will send it,&mdash;and what I send is not to be answered,
    remember!
</p>
<p>
    I read Luria's first act twice through before I slept last night, and
    feel just as a bullet might feel, not because of the lead of it but
    because shot into the air and suddenly arrested and suspended. It
    ('Luria') is all life, and we know (that is, the reader knows) that
    there must be results here and here. How fine that sight of Luria is
    upon the lynx hides&mdash;how you see the Moor in him just in the glimpse
    you have by the eyes of another&mdash;and that laugh when the horse drops
    the forage, what wonderful truth and character you have in
    <i>that</i>!&mdash;And then, when <i>he</i> is in the scene&mdash;: 'Golden-hearted Luria'
    you called him once to me, and his heart shines already ... wide open
    to the morning sun. The construction seems to me very clear
    everywhere&mdash;and the rhythm, even over-smooth in a few verses, where
    you invert a little artificially&mdash;but that shall be set down on a
    separate strip of paper: and in the meantime I am snatched up into
    'Luria' and feel myself driven on to the ends of the poet, just as a
    reader should.
</p>
<p>
    But <i>you</i> are not driven on to any ends? so as to be tired, I mean?
    You will not suffer yourself to be overworked because you are
    'interested' in this work. I am so certain that the sensations in your
    head <i>demand</i> repose; and it must be so injurious to you to be
    perpetually calling, calling these new creations, one after another,
    that you must consent to be called <i>to</i>, and not hurry the next act,
    no, nor any act&mdash;let the people have time to learn the last number by
    heart. And how glad I am that Mr. Fox should say what he did of it ...
    though it wasn't true, you know ... not exactly. Still, I do hold that
    as far as construction goes, you never put together so much
    unquestionable, smooth glory before, ... not a single entanglement for
    the understanding ... unless 'the snowdrops' make an exception&mdash;while
    for the undeniableness of genius it never stood out before your
    readers more plainly than in that same number! Also you have extended
    your sweep of power&mdash;the sea-weed is thrown farther (if not higher)
    than it was found before; and one may calculate surely now how a few
    more waves will cover the brown stones and float the sight up away
    through the fissure of the rocks. The rhythm (to touch one of the
    various things) the rhythm of that 'Duchess' does more and more strike
    me as a new thing; something like (if like anything) what the Greeks
    called pedestrian-metre, ... between metre and prose ... the difficult
    rhymes combining too quite curiously with the easy looseness of the
    general measure. Then 'The Ride'&mdash;with that touch of natural feeling
    at the end, to prove that it was not in brutal carelessness that the
    poor horse was driven through all that suffering ... yes, and how that
    one touch of softness acts back upon the energy and resolution and
    exalts both, instead of weakening anything, as might have been
    expected by the vulgar of writers or critics. And then 'Saul'&mdash;and in
    a first place 'St. Praxed'&mdash;and for pure description, 'Fortú' and the
    deep 'Pictor Ignotus'&mdash;and the noble, serene 'Italy in England,' which
    grows on you the more you know of it&mdash;and that delightful 'Glove'&mdash;and
    the short lyrics ... for one comes to <i>'select' everything</i> at last,
    and certainly I do like these poems better and better, as your poems
    are made to be liked. But you will be tired to hear it said over and
    over so, ... and I am going to 'Luria,' besides.
</p>
<p>
    When you write will you say exactly how you are? and will you write?
    And I want to explain to you that although I don't make a profession
    of equable spirits, (as a matter of temperament, my spirits were
    always given to rock a little, up and down) yet that I did not mean to
    be so ungrateful and wicked as to complain of low spirits now and to
    you. It would not be true either: and I said 'low' to express a merely
    bodily state. My opium comes in to keep the pulse from fluttering and
    fainting ... to give the right composure and point of balance to the
    nervous system. I don't take it for 'my spirits' in the usual sense;
    you must not think such a thing. The medical man who came to see me
    made me take it the other day when he was in the room, before the
    right hour and when I was talking quite cheerfully, just for the need
    he observed in the pulse. 'It was a necessity of my position,' he
    said. Also I do not suffer from it in any way, as people usually do
    who take opium. I am not even subject to an opium-headache. As to the
    low spirits I will not say that mine <i>have not</i> been low enough and
    with cause enough; but <i>even then</i>, ... why if you were to ask the
    nearest witnesses, ... say, even my own sisters, ... everybody would
    tell you, I think, that the 'cheerfulness' even <i>then</i>, was the
    remarkable thing in me&mdash;certainly it has been remarked about me again
    and again. Nobody has known that it was an effort (a habit of effort)
    to throw the light on the outside,&mdash;I do abhor so that ignoble
    groaning aloud of the 'groans of Testy and Sensitude'&mdash;yet I may say
    that for three years I never was conscious of one movement of pleasure
    in anything. Think if I could mean to complain of 'low spirits' now,
    and to you. Why it would be like complaining of not being able to see
    at noon&mdash;which would simply prove that I was very blind. And you, who
    are not blind, cannot make out what is written&mdash;so you <i>need not try</i>.
    May God bless you long after you have done blessing me!
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your own&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    Now I am half tempted to tear this letter in two (and it is long
    enough for three) and to send you only the latter half. But you will
    understand&mdash;you will not think that there is a contradiction between
    the first and last ... you <i>cannot</i>. One is a truth of me&mdash;and the
    other a truth of you&mdash;and we two are different, you know.
</p>
<p>
    You are not over-working in 'Luria'? That you <i>should not</i>, is a
    truth, too.
</p>
<p>
    I observed that Mr. Kenyon put in '<i>Junior</i>' to your address. Ought
    that to be done? or does my fashion of directing find you without
    hesitation?
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon asked me for Mr. Chorley's book, or you should have it.
    Shall I send it to you presently?

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, November 17, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    At last your letter comes&mdash;and the deep joy&mdash;(I know and use to
    analyse my own feelings, and be sober in giving distinctive names to
    their varieties; this is <i>deep</i> joy,)&mdash;the true love with which I
    take this much of you into my heart, ... <i>that</i> proves what it is I
    wanted so long, and find at last, and am happy for ever. I must have
    more than 'intimated'&mdash;I must have spoken plainly out the truth, if I
    do myself the barest justice, and told you long ago that the
    admiration at your works went <i>away</i>, quite another way and afar from
    the love of you. If I could fancy some method of what I shall say
    happening without all the obvious stumbling-blocks of falseness, &amp;c.
    which no foolish fancy dares associate with you ... if you <SPAN class="sc-ex">could</span> tell
    me when I next sit by you&mdash;'I will undeceive you,&mdash;I am not <i>the</i> Miss
    B.&mdash;she is up-stairs and you shall see her&mdash;I only wrote those
    letters, and am what you see, that is all now left you' (all the
    misapprehension having arisen from <i>me</i>, in some inexplicable way) ...
    I should not begin by <i>saying</i> anything, dear, dearest&mdash;but <i>after
    that</i>, I should assure you&mdash;soon make you believe that I did not much
    wonder at the event, for I have been all my life asking what
    connection there is between the satisfaction at the display of power,
    and the sympathy with&mdash;ever-increasing sympathy with&mdash;all imaginable
    weakness? Look now: Coleridge writes on and on,&mdash;at last he writes a
    note to his 'War-Eclogue,' in which he avers himself to have been
    actuated by a really&mdash;on the whole&mdash;<i>benevolent</i> feeling to Mr. Pitt
    when he wrote that stanza in which 'Fire' means to 'cling to him
    everlastingly'&mdash;where is the long line of admiration now that the end
    snaps? And now&mdash;here I refuse to fancy&mdash;you <SPAN class="sc-ex">know</span> whether, if you never
    write another line, speak another intelligible word, recognize me by a
    look again&mdash;whether I shall love you less or <i>more</i> ... <SPAN class="sc-ex">more</span>; having a
    right to expect more strength with the strange emergency. And it is
    because I know this, build upon this entirely, that as a reasonable
    creature, I am bound to look first to what hangs farthest and most
    loosely from me ... what <i>might</i> go from you to your loss, and so to
    mine, to say the least ... because I want <SPAN class="sc-ex">all</span> of you, not just so much
    as I could not live without&mdash;and because I see the danger of your
    entirely generous disposition and cannot quite, yet, bring myself to
    profit by it in the quiet way you recommend. Always remember, I never
    wrote to you, all the years, on the strength of your poetry, though I
    constantly heard of you through Mr. K. and was near seeing you once,
    and might have easily availed myself of his intervention to commend
    any letter to your notice, so as to reach you out of the foolish crowd
    of rushers-in upon genius ... who come and eat their bread and cheese
    on the high-altar, and talk of reverence without one of its surest
    instincts&mdash;never quiet till they cut their initials on the cheek of
    the Medicean Venus to prove they worship her. My admiration, as I
    said, went its natural way in silence&mdash;but when on my return to
    England in December, late in the month, Mr. K. sent those Poems to my
    sister, and I read my name there&mdash;and when, a day or two after, I met
    him and, beginning to speak my mind on them, and getting on no better
    than I should now, said quite naturally&mdash;'if I were to <i>write</i> this,
    now?'&mdash;and he assured me with his perfect kindness, you would be even
    'pleased' to hear from me under those circumstances ... nay,&mdash;for I
    will tell you all, in this, in everything&mdash;when he wrote me a note
    soon after to reassure me on that point ... <SPAN class="sc-ex">then</span> I <i>did</i> write, on
    <i>account of my purely personal obligation</i>, though of course taking
    that occasion to allude to the general and customary delight in your
    works: I did write, on the whole, <SPAN class="sc-ex">unwillingly</span> ... with consciousness
    of having to <i>speak</i> on a subject which I <i>felt</i> thoroughly
    concerning, and could not be satisfied with an imperfect expression
    of. As for expecting <SPAN class="sc-ex">then</span> what has followed ... I shall only say I was
    scheming how to get done with England and go to my heart in Italy. And
    now, my love&mdash;I am round you ... my whole life is wound up and down
    and over you.... I feel you stir everywhere. I am not conscious of
    thinking or feeling but <i>about</i> you, with some reference to you&mdash;so I
    will live, so may I die! And you have blessed me <i>beyond</i> the <i>bond</i>,
    in more than in giving me yourself to love; inasmuch as you believed
    me from the first ... what you call 'dream-work' <i>was</i> real of its
    kind, did you not think? and now you believe me, <i>I</i> believe and am
    happy, in what I write with my heart full of love for you. Why do you
    tell me of a doubt, as now, and bid me not clear it up, 'not answer
    you?' Have I done wrong in thus answering? Never, never do <i>me</i> direct
    <i>wrong</i> and hide for a moment from me what a word can explain as now.
    You see, you thought, if but for a moment, I loved your intellect&mdash;or
    what predominates in your poetry and is most distinct from your
    heart&mdash;better, or as well as you&mdash;did you not? and I have told you
    every thing,&mdash;explained everything ... have I not? And now I will dare
    ... yes, dearest, kiss you back to my heart again; my own. There&mdash;and
    there!
</p>
<p>
    And since I wrote what is above, I have been reading among other poems
    that sonnet&mdash;'Past and Future'&mdash;which affects me more than any poem I
    ever read. How can I put your poetry away from you, even in these
    ineffectual attempts to concentrate myself upon, and better apply
    myself to what remains?&mdash;poor, poor work it is; for is not that sonnet
    to be loved as a true utterance of yours? I cannot attempt to put down
    the thoughts that rise; may God bless me, as you pray, by letting that
    beloved hand shake the less ... I will only ask, <i>the less</i> ... for
    being laid on mine through this life! And, indeed, you write down, for
    me to calmly read, that I make you happy! Then it is&mdash;as with all
    power&mdash;God through the weakest instrumentality ... and I am past
    expression proud and grateful&mdash;My love,
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am your</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R.B.
</p>
<p>
    I must answer your questions: I am better&mdash;and will certainly have
    your injunction before my eyes and work quite moderately. Your letters
    come <i>straight</i> to me&mdash;my father's go to Town, except on extraordinary
    occasions, so that <i>all</i> come for my first looking-over. I saw Mr. K.
    last night at the Amateur Comedy&mdash;and heaps of old acquaintances&mdash;and
    came home tired and savage&mdash;and <i>yearned</i> literally, for a letter this
    morning, and so it came and I was well again. So, I am not even to
    have your low spirits leaning on mine? It was just because I always
    find you alike, and <i>ever</i> like yourself, that I seemed to discern a
    depth, when you spoke of 'some days' and what they made uneven where
    all is agreeable to <i>me</i>. Do not, now, deprive me of a right&mdash;a right
    ... to find you as you <i>are</i>; get no habit of being cheerful with
    me&mdash;I have universal sympathy and can show you a <SPAN class="sc-ex">side</span> of me, a true
    face, turn as you may. If you <i>are</i> cheerful ... so will I be ... if
    sad, my cheerfulness will be all the while <i>behind</i>, and propping up,
    any sadness that meets yours, if that should be necessary. As for my
    question about the opium ... you do not misunderstand <i>that</i> neither:
    I trust in the eventual consummation of my&mdash;shall I not say,
    <i>our</i>&mdash;hopes; and all that bears upon your health immediately or
    prospectively, affects me&mdash;how it affects me! Will you write again?
    <i>Wednesday</i>, remember! Mr. K. wants me to go to him one of the three
    next days after. I will bring you some letters ... one from Landor.
    Why should I trouble you about 'Pomfret.'
</p>
<p>
    And Luria ... does it so interest you? Better is to come of it. How
    you lift me up!&mdash;

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Monday.<br>
[Post-mark, November 18, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    How you overcome me as always you do&mdash;and where is the answer to
    anything except too deep down in the heart for even the pearl-divers?
    But understand ... what you do not quite ... that I did not mistake
    you as far even as you say here and even 'for a moment.' I did not
    write any of that letter in a 'doubt' of you&mdash;not a word.... I was
    simply looking back in it on my own states of feeling, ... looking
    back from that point of your praise to what was better ... (or I
    should not have looked back)&mdash;and so coming to tell you, by a natural
    association, how the completely opposite point to that of any praise
    was the one which struck me first and most, viz. the no-reason of your
    reasoning ... acknowledged to be yours. Of course I acknowledge it to
    be yours, ... that high reason of no reason&mdash;I acknowledged it to be
    yours (didn't I?) in acknowledging that it made an impression on me.
    And then, referring to the traditions of my experience such as I told
    them to you, I meant, so, farther to acknowledge that I would rather
    be cared for in <i>that</i> unreasonable way, than for the best reason in
    the world. But all <i>that</i> was history and philosophy simply&mdash;was it
    not?&mdash;and not <i>doubt of you</i>.
</p>
<p>
    The truth is ... since we really are talking truths in this world ...
    that I never have doubted you&mdash;ah, you <i>know</i>!&mdash;I felt from the
    beginning so sure of the nobility and integrity in you that I would
    have trusted you to make a path for my soul&mdash;<i>that</i>, you <i>know</i>. I
    felt certain that you believed of yourself every word you spoke or
    wrote&mdash;and you must not blame me if I thought besides sometimes (it
    was the extent of my thought) that you were self-deceived as to the
    nature of your own feelings. If you could turn over every page of my
    heart like the pages of a book, you would see nothing there offensive
    to the least of your feelings ... not even to the outside fringes of
    your man's vanity ... should you have any vanity like a man; which I
    <i>do</i> doubt. I never wronged you in the least of things&mdash;never ... I
    thank God for it. But 'self-deceived,' it was so easy for you to be:
    see how on every side and day by day, men are&mdash;and women too&mdash;in this
    sort of feelings. 'Self-deceived,' it was so possible for you to be,
    and while I thought it possible, could I help thinking it <i>best</i> for
    you that it should be so&mdash;and was it not right in me to persist in
    thinking it possible? It was my reverence for you that made me
    persist! What was <i>I</i> that I should think otherwise? I had been shut
    up here too long face to face with my own spirit, not to know myself,
    and, so, to have lost the common illusions of vanity. All the men I
    had ever known could not make your stature among them. So it was not
    distrust, but reverence rather. I sate by while the angel stirred the
    water, and I called it <i>Miracle</i>. Do not blame me now, ... <i>my</i> angel!
</p>
<p>
    Nor say, that I 'do not lean' on you with all the weight of my 'past'
    ... because I do! You cannot guess what you are to me&mdash;you cannot&mdash;it
    is not possible:&mdash;and though I have said <i>that</i> before, I must say it
    again ... for it comes again to be said. It is something to me between
    dream and miracle, all of it&mdash;as if some dream of my earliest
    brightest dreaming-time had been lying through these dark years to
    steep in the sunshine, returning to me in a double light. <i>Can</i> it be,
    I say to myself, that <i>you</i> feel for me <i>so</i>? can it be meant for me?
    this from <i>you</i>?
</p>
<p>
    If it is your 'right' that I should be gloomy at will with you, you
    exercise it, I do think&mdash;for although I cannot promise to be very
    sorrowful when you come, (how could that be?) yet from different
    motives it seems to me that I have written to you quite superfluities
    about my 'abomination of desolation,'&mdash;yes indeed, and blamed myself
    afterwards. And now I must say this besides. When grief came upon
    grief, I never was tempted to ask 'How have I deserved this of God,'
    as sufferers sometimes do: I always felt that there must be cause
    enough ... corruption enough, needing purification ... weakness
    enough, needing strengthening ... <i>nothing</i> of the chastisement could
    come to me without cause and need. But in this different hour, when
    joy follows joy, and God makes me happy, as you say, <i>through</i> you ...
    I cannot repress the ... 'How have I deserved <i>this</i> of Him?'&mdash;I know
    I have not&mdash;I know I do not.
</p>
<p>
    Could it be that heart and life were devastated to make room for
    you?&mdash;If so, it was well done,&mdash;dearest! They leave the ground fallow
    before the wheat.
</p>
<p>
    'Were you wrong in answering?' Surely not ... unless it is wrong to
    show all this goodness ... and too much, it may be for <i>me</i>. When the
    plants droop for drought and the copious showers fall suddenly, silver
    upon silver, they die sometimes of the reverse of their adversities.
    But no&mdash;<i>that</i>, even, shall not be a danger! And if I said 'Do not
    answer,' I did not mean that I would not have a doubt removed&mdash;(having
    <i>no</i> doubt!&mdash;) but I was simply unwilling to seem to be asking for
    golden words ... going down the aisles with that large silken purse,
    as <i>quêteuse</i>. Try to understand.
</p>
<p>
    On Wednesday then!&mdash;George is invited to meet you on Thursday at Mr.
    Kenyon's.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Examiner</i> speaks well, upon the whole, and with allowances ...
    oh, that absurdity about metaphysics apart from poetry!&mdash;'Can such
    things be' in one of the best reviews of the day? Mr. Kenyon was here
    on Sunday and talking of the poems with real living tears in his eyes
    and on his cheeks. But I will tell you. 'Luria' is to climb to the
    place of a great work, I see. And if I write too long letters, is it
    not because you spoil me, and because (being spoilt) I cannot help
    it?&mdash;May God bless you always&mdash;

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday Morning.
</p>
<p>
    Here is the copy of Landor's verses.
</p>
<p>
    You know thoroughly, do you not, why I brought all those good-natured
    letters, desperate praise and all? Not, <i>not</i> out of the least vanity
    in the world&mdash;nor to help myself in your sight with such testimony:
    would it seem very extravagant, on the contrary, if I said that
    perhaps I laid them before your eyes in a real fit of compunction at
    not being, in my heart, thankful enough for the evident motive of the
    writers,&mdash;and so was determined to give them the 'last honours' if
    not the first, and not make them miss <i>you</i> because, through my fault,
    they had missed <i>me</i>? Does this sound too fantastical? Because it is
    strictly true: the most laudatory of all, I <i>skimmed</i> once over with
    my flesh <i>creeping</i>&mdash;it seemed such a death-struggle, that of good
    nature over&mdash;well, it is fresh ingratitude of me, so here it shall
    end.
</p>
<p>
    I am not ungrateful to <i>you</i>&mdash;but you must wait to know that:&mdash;I can
    speak less than nothing with my living lips.
</p>
<p>
    I mean to ask your brother how you are to-night ... so quietly!
</p>
<p>
    God bless you, my dearest, and reward you.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your R.B.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Shelley&mdash;with the 'Ricordi.'
</p>
<p>
    Of course, Landor's praise is altogether a different gift; a gold vase
    from King Hiram; beside he has plenty of conscious rejoicing in his
    own riches, and is not left painfully poor by what he sends away.
    <i>That</i> is the unpleasant point with some others&mdash;they spread you a
    board and want to gird up their loins and wait on you there. Landor
    says 'come up higher and let us sit and eat together.' Is it not that?
</p>
<p>
    Now&mdash;you are not to turn on me because the first is my proper feeling
    to <i>you</i>, ... for poetry is not the thing given or taken between
    us&mdash;it is heart and life and <i>my</i>self, not <i>mine</i>, I give&mdash;give? That
    you glorify and change and, in returning then, give <i>me</i>!
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday.<br>
[Post-mark, November 21, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Thank you! and will you, if your sister made the copy of Landor's
    verses for <i>me</i> as well as for you, thank <i>her</i> from me for another
    kindness, ... not the second nor the third? For my own part, be sure
    that if I did not fall on the right subtle interpretation about the
    letters, at least I did not 'think it vain' of you! vain: when,
    supposing you really to have been over-gratified by such letters, it
    could have proved only an excess of humility!&mdash;But ... besides the
    subtlety,&mdash;you meant to be kind to <i>me</i>, you know,&mdash;and I had a
    pleasure and an interest in reading them&mdash;only that ... mind. Sir John
    Hanmer's, I was half angry with! Now <i>is</i> he not cold?&mdash;and is it not
    easy to see <i>why</i> he is forced to write his own scenes five times over
    and over? He might have mentioned the 'Duchess' I think; and he a
    poet! Mr. Chorley speaks some things very well&mdash;but what does he mean
    about 'execution,' <i>en revanche</i>? but I liked his letter and his
    candour in the last page of it. Will Mr. Warburton review you? does he
    mean <i>that</i>? Now do let me see any other letters you receive. <i>May</i> I?
    Of course Landor's 'dwells apart' from all: and besides the reason you
    give for being gratified by it, it is well that one prophet should
    open his mouth and prophesy and give his witness to the inspiration of
    another. See what he says in the letter.... '<i>You may stand quite
    alone if you will&mdash;and I think you will.' That</i> is a noble testimony
    to a <i>truth</i>. And he discriminates&mdash;he understands and discerns&mdash;they
    are not words thrown out into the air. The 'profusion of imagery
    covering the depth of thought' is a true description. And, in the
    verses, he lays his finger just on your characteristics&mdash;just on those
    which, when you were only a poet to me, (only a poet: does it sound
    irreverent? almost, I think!) which, when you were only a poet to me,
    I used to study, characteristic by characteristic, and turn myself
    round and round in despair of being ever able to approach, taking them
    to be so essentially and intensely masculine that like effects were
    unattainable, even in a lower degree, by any female hand. Did I not
    tell you so once before? or oftener than once? And must not these
    verses of Landor's be printed somewhere&mdash;in the <i>Examiner</i>? and again
    in the <i>Athenæum</i>? if in the <i>Examiner</i>, certainly again in the
    <i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;it would be a matter of course. Oh those verses: how they
    have pleased me! It was an act worthy of him&mdash;and of <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
    George has been properly 'indoctrinated,' and, we must hope, will do
    credit to my instructions. Just now ... just as I was writing ... he
    came in to say good-morning and good-night (he goes to chambers
    earlier than I receive visitors generally), and to ask with a smile,
    if I had 'a message for my friend' ... <i>that</i> was you ... and so he
    was indoctrinated. He is good and true, honest and kind, but a little
    over-grave and reasonable, as I and my sisters complain continually.
    The great Law lime-kiln dries human souls all to one colour&mdash;and he is
    an industrious reader among law books and knows a good deal about
    them, I have heard from persons who can judge; but with a sacrifice of
    impulsiveness and liberty of spirit, which <i>I</i> should regret for him
    if he sate on the Woolsack even. Oh&mdash;that law! how I do detest it! I
    hate it and think ill of it&mdash;I tell George so sometimes&mdash;and he is
    good-natured and only thinks to himself (a little audibly now and
    then) that I am a woman and talking nonsense. But the morals of it,
    and the philosophy of it! And the manners of it! in which the whole
    host of barristers looks down on the attorneys and the rest of the
    world!&mdash;how long are these things to last!
</p>
<p>
    Theodosia Garrow, I have seen face to face once or twice. She is very
    clever&mdash;very accomplished&mdash;with talents and tastes of various kinds&mdash;a
    musician and linguist, in most modern languages I believe&mdash;and a
    writer of fluent graceful melodious verses, ... you cannot say any
    more. At least <i>I</i> cannot&mdash;and though I have not seen this last poem
    in the 'Book of Beauty,' I have no more trust ready for it than for
    its predecessors, of which Mr. Landor said as much. It is the personal
    feeling which speaks in him, I fancy&mdash;simply the personal
    feeling&mdash;and, <i>that</i> being the case, it does not spoil the
    discriminating appreciation on the other page of this letter. I might
    have the modesty to admit besides that I may be wrong and he, right,
    all through. But ... 'more intense than Sappho'!&mdash;more intense than
    intensity itself!&mdash;to think of <i>that</i>!&mdash;Also the word 'poetry' has a
    clear meaning to me, and all the fluency and facility and quick
    ear-catching of a tune which one can find in the world, do not answer
    to it&mdash;no.
</p>
<p>
    How is the head? will you tell me? I have written all this without a
    word of it, and yet ever since yesterday I have been uneasy, ... I
    cannot help it. You see you are not better but worse. 'Since you were
    in Italy'&mdash;Then is it England that disagrees with you? and is it
    change away from England that you want? ... <i>require</i>, I mean. If
    so&mdash;why what follows and ought to follow? You must not be ill
    indeed&mdash;<i>that</i> is the first necessity. Tell me how you are, exactly
    how you are; and remember to walk, and not to work too much&mdash;for my
    sake&mdash;if you care for me&mdash;if it is not too bold of me to say so. I had
    fancied you were looking better rather than otherwise: but those
    sensations in the head are frightful and ought to be stopped by
    whatever means; even by the worst, as they would seem to <i>me</i>.
    Well&mdash;it was bad news to hear of the increase of pain; for the
    amendment was a 'passing show' I fear, and not caused even by thoughts
    of mine or it would have appeared before; while on the other side (the
    sunny side of the way) I heard on that same yesterday, what made me
    glad as good news, a whole gospel of good news, and from <i>you</i> too who
    profess to say 'less than nothing,' and <i>that</i> was that '<i>the times
    seemed longer to you</i>':&mdash;do you remember saying it? And it made me
    glad ... happy&mdash;perhaps too glad and happy&mdash;and surprised: yes,
    surprised!&mdash;for if you had told me (but you would not have told me) if
    you had let me guess ... just the contrary, ... '<i>that the times
    seemed shorter</i>,' ... why it would have seemed to <i>me</i> as natural as
    nature&mdash;oh, believe me it would, and I could not have thought hardly
    of you for it in the most secret or silent of my thoughts. How am I
    to feel towards you, do you imagine, ... who have the world round you
    and yet make me this to you? I never can tell you how, and you never
    can know it without having my heart in you with all its experiences:
    we measure by those weights. May God bless you! and save <i>me</i> from
    being the cause to you of any harm or grief!... I choose it for <i>my</i>
    blessing instead of another. What should I be if I could fail
    willingly to you in the least thing? But I <i>never will</i>, and you know
    it. I will not move, nor speak, nor breathe, so as willingly and
    consciously to touch, with one shade of wrong, that precious deposit
    of 'heart and life' ... which may yet be recalled.
</p>
<p>
    And, so, may God bless you and your
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    Remember to say how you are.
</p>
<p>
    I sent 'Pomfret'&mdash;and Shelley is returned, and the letters, in the
    same parcel&mdash;but my letter goes by the post as you see. Is there
    contrast enough between the two rival female personages of 'Pomfret.'
    <i>I</i> fancy not. Helena should have been more 'demonstrative' than she
    appeared in Italy, to secure the 'new modulation' with Walter. But you
    will not think it a strong book, I am sure, with all the good and pure
    intention of it. The best character ... most life-like ... as
    conventional life goes ... seems to <i>me</i> 'Mr. Rose' ... beyond all
    comparison&mdash;and the best point, the noiseless, unaffected manner in
    which the acting out of the 'private judgment' in Pomfret himself is
    made no heroic virtue but simply an integral part of the love of
    truth. As to Grace she is too good to be interesting, I am afraid&mdash;and
    people say of her more than she expresses&mdash;and as to 'generosity,' she
    could not do otherwise in the last scenes.
</p>
<p>
    But I will not tell you the story after all.
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of this letter I meant to write just one page; but my
    generosity is like Grace's, and could not help itself. There were the
    letters to write of, and the verses! and then, you know, 'femme qui
    parle' never has done. <i>Let</i> me hear! and I will be as brisk as a
    monument next time for variety.

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday Night.<br>
[Post-mark, November 22, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    How good and kind to send me these books! (The letter I say nothing
    of, according to convention: if I wrote down 'best and kindest' ...
    oh, what poorest words!) I shall tell you all about 'Pomfret,' be
    sure. Chorley talked of it, as we walked homewards together last
    night,&mdash;modestly and well, and spoke of having given away two copies
    only ... to his mother one, and the other to&mdash;Miss Barrett, and 'she
    seemed interested in the life of it, entered into his purpose in it,'
    and I listened to it all, loving Chorley for his loveability which is
    considerable at other times, and saying to myself what might run
    better in the child's couplet&mdash;'Not more than others I deserve, Though
    God has given me more'!&mdash;Given me the letter which expresses surprise
    that I shall feel these blanks between the days when I see you longer
    and longer! So am <i>I</i> surprised&mdash;that I should have mentioned so
    obvious a matter at all; or leave unmentioned a hundred others its
    correlatives which I cannot conceive you to be ignorant of, you! When
    I spread out my riches before me, and think <i>what</i> the hour and more
    means that you endow one with, I <i>do</i>&mdash;not to say <i>could</i>&mdash;I <i>do</i> form
    resolutions, and say to myself&mdash;'If next time I am bidden stay away a
    <SPAN class="sc-ex">fortnight</span>, I will not reply by a word beyond the grateful assent.' I
    <i>do</i>, God knows, lay up in my heart these priceless treasures,&mdash;shall
    I tell you? I never in my life kept a journal, a register of sights,
    or fancies, or feelings; in my last travel I put down on a slip of
    paper a few dates, that I might remember in England, on such a day I
    was on Vesuvius, in Pompeii, at Shelley's grave; all that should be
    kept in memory is, with <i>me</i>, best left to the brain's own process.
    But I have, from the first, recorded the date and the duration of
    every visit to you; the numbers of minutes you have given me ... and I
    put them together till they make ... nearly two days now;
    four-and-twenty-hour-long-days, that I have been <i>by you</i>&mdash;and I enter
    the room determining to get up and go sooner ... and I go away into
    the light street repenting that I went so soon by I don't know how
    many minutes&mdash;for, love, what is it all, this love for you, but an
    earnest desiring to include you in myself, if that might be; to feel
    you in my very heart and hold you there for ever, through all chance
    and earthly changes!
</p>
<p>
    There, I had better leave off; the words!
</p>
<p>
    I was very glad to find myself with your brother yesterday; I like him
    very much and mean to get a friend in him&mdash;(to supply the loss of my
    friend ... Miss Barrett&mdash;which is gone, the friendship, so gone!) But
    I did not ask after you because I heard Moxon do it. Now of Landor's
    verses: I got a note from Forster yesterday telling me that he, too,
    had received a copy ... so that there is no injunction to be secret.
    So I got a copy for dear Mr. Kenyon, and, lo! what comes! I send the
    note to make you smile! I shall reply that I felt in duty bound to
    apprise you; as I did. You will observe that I go to that too facile
    gate of his on Tuesday, <i>my day</i> ... from your house directly. The
    worst is that I have got entangled with invitations already, and must
    go out again, <i>hating</i> it, to more than one place.
</p>
<p>
    I am <i>very</i> well&mdash;quite well; yes, dearest! The pain is quite gone;
    and the inconvenience, hard on its trace. You will write to me again,
    will you not? And be as brief as your heart lets you, to me who hoard
    up your words and get remote and imperfect ideas of what ... shall it
    be written?... anger at you could mean, when I see a line blotted out;
    a <i>second-thoughted</i> finger-tip rapidly put forth upon one of my gold
    pieces!
</p>
<p>
    I rather think if Warburton reviews me it will be in the <i>Quarterly</i>,
    which I know he writes for. Hanmer is a very sculpturesque passionless
    high-minded and amiable man ... this coldness, as you see it, is part
    of him. I like his poems, I think, better than you&mdash;'the Sonnets,' do
    you know them? Not 'Fra Cipolla.' See what is here, since you will not
    let me have only you to look at&mdash;this is Landor's first
    opinion&mdash;expressed to Forster&mdash;see the date! and last of all, see me
    and know me, beloved! May God bless you!
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.<br>
[Post-mark, November 22, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon came yesterday&mdash;and do you know when he took out those
    verses and spoke his preface and I understood what was to follow, I
    had a temptation from my familiar Devil not to say I had read them
    before&mdash;I had the temptation strong and clear. For he (Mr. K.) told me
    that your sister let him see them&mdash;.
</p>
<p>
    But no&mdash;My 'vade retro' prevailed, and I spoke the truth and shamed
    the devil and surprised Mr. Kenyon besides, as I could observe. Not an
    observation did he make till he was just going away half an hour
    afterwards, and then he said rather dryly ... 'And now may I ask how
    long ago it was when you first read these verses?&mdash;was it a fortnight
    ago?' It was better, I think, that I should not have made a mystery of
    such a simple thing, ... and yet I felt half vexed with myself and
    with him besides. But the verses,&mdash;how he praised them! more than I
    thought of doing ... as verses&mdash;though there is beauty and music and
    all that ought to be. Do you see clearly now that the latter lines
    refer to the combination in you,&mdash;the qualities over and above those
    held in common with Chaucer? And I have heard this morning from two or
    three of the early readers of the <i>Chronicle</i> (I never care to see it
    till the evening) that the verses are there&mdash;so that my wishes have
    fulfilled themselves <i>there</i> at least&mdash;strangely, for wishes of mine
    ... which generally 'go by contraries' as the soothsayers declare of
    dreams. How kind of you to send me the fragment to Mr. Forster! and
    how I like to read it. Was the Hebrew yours <i>then</i> ... <i>written then</i>,
    I mean ... or written <i>now</i>?
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon told me that you were to dine with him on Tuesday, and I
    took for granted, at first hearing, that you would come on Wednesday
    perhaps to me&mdash;and afterwards I saw the possibility of the two ends
    being joined without much difficulty. Still, I was not sure, before
    your letter came, how it might be.
</p>
<p>
    That you really are better is the best news of all&mdash;thank you for
    telling me. It will be wise not to go out <i>too</i> much&mdash;'aequam servare
    mentem' as Landor quotes, ... in this as in the rest. Perhaps that
    worst pain was a sort of crisis ... the sharp turn of the road about
    to end ... oh, I do trust it may be so.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. K. wrote to Landor to the effect that it was not because he (Mr.
    K.) held you in affection, nor because the verses expressed critically
    the opinion entertained of you by all who could judge, nor because
    they praised a book with which his own name was associated ... but for
    the abstract beauty of those verses ... for <i>that</i> reason he could not
    help naming them to Mr. Landor. All of which was repeated to me
    yesterday.
</p>
<p>
    Also I heard of you from George, who admired you&mdash;admired you ... as
    if you were a chancellor in <i>posse</i>, a great lawyer in <i>esse</i>&mdash;and
    then he thought you ... what he never could think a lawyer ...
    '<i>unassuming</i>.' And <i>you</i> ... you are so kind! Only <i>that</i> makes me
    think bitterly what I have thought before, but cannot write to-day.
</p>
<p>
    It was good-natured of Mr. Chorley to send me a copy of his book, and
    he sending so few&mdash;very! George who admires <i>you</i>, does not tolerate
    Mr. Chorley ... (did I tell ever?) declares that the affectation is
    'bad,' and that there is a dash of vulgarity ... which I positively
    refuse to believe, and <i>should</i>, I fancy, though face to face with the
    most vainglorious of waistcoats. How can there be vulgarity even of
    manners, with so much mental refinement? I never could believe in
    those combinations of contradictions.
</p>
<p>
    'An obvious matter,' you think! as obvious, as your 'green hill' ...
    which I cannot see. For the rest ... my thought upon your 'great
    <i>fact</i>' of the 'two days,' is quite different from yours ... for I
    think directly, 'So little'! so dreadfully little! What shallow earth
    for a deep root! What can be known of me in that time? 'So <i>there</i>, is
    the only good, you see, that comes from making calculations on a slip
    of paper! It is not and it cannot come to good.' I would rather look
    at my seventy-five letters&mdash;there is room to breathe in them. And this
    is my idea (<i>ecce</i>!) of monumental brevity&mdash;and <i>hic jacet</i> at last

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Night.<br>
[Post-mark, November 24, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    But a word to-night, my love&mdash;for my head aches a little,&mdash;I had to
    write a long letter to my friend at New Zealand, and now I want to sit
    and think of you and get well&mdash;but I must not quite lose the word I
    counted on.
</p>
<p>
    So, <i>that</i> way you will take my two days and turn them against me?
    <i>Oh, you!</i> Did I say the 'root' had been striking then, or rather,
    that the seeds, whence the roots take leisure and grow, <i>they</i> had
    been planted then&mdash;and might not a good heart and hand drop acorns
    enough to grow up into a complete Dodona-grove,&mdash;when the very rook,
    say farmers, hides and forgets whole navies of ship-wood one day to
    be, in his summer storing-journeys? But this shall do&mdash;I am not going
    to prove what <i>may</i> be, when here it <i>is</i>, to my everlasting
    happiness.
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;And 'I am kind'&mdash;there again! Do I not know what you mean by that?
    Well it is some comfort that you make all even in some degree, and
    take from my faculties here what you give them, spite of my
    protesting, in other directions. So I could not when I first saw you
    admire you very much, and wish for your friendship, and be willing to
    give you mine, and desirous of any opportunity of serving you,
    benefiting you; I could not think the finding myself in a position to
    feel this, just this and no more, a sufficiently fortunate event ...
    but I must needs get up, or imitate, or ... what is it you fancy I do?
    ... an utterly distinct, unnecessary, inconsequential regard for you,
    which should, when it got too hard for shamming at the week's
    end,&mdash;should simply spoil, in its explosion and departure, all the
    real and sufficing elements of an honest life-long attachment and
    affections! that I should do this, and think it a piece of kindness
    does....
</p>
<p>
    Now, I'll tell you what it <i>does</i> deserve, and what it shall get. Give
    me, dearest beyond expression, what I have always dared to think I
    would ask you for ... one day! Give me ... wait&mdash;for your own sake,
    not mine who never, never dream of being worth such a gift ... but for
    your own sense of justice, and to <i>say</i>, so as my heart shall hear,
    that you were wrong and are no longer so, give me so much of you&mdash;all
    precious that you are&mdash;as may be given in a lock of your hair&mdash;I will
    live and die with it, and with the memory of you&mdash;this <i>at</i> the
    <i>worst</i>! If you give me what I beg,&mdash;shall I say next Tuesday ... when
    I leave you, I will not speak a word. If you do not, I will not think
    you unjust, for all my light words, but I will pray you to wait and
    remember me one day&mdash;when the power to deserve more may be greater ...
    never the will. God supplies all things: may he bless you, beloved! So
    I can but pray, kissing your hand.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R.B.
</p>
<p>
    Now pardon me, dearest, for what is written ... what I cannot cancel,
    for the love's sake that it grew from.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Chronicle</i> was through Moxon, I believe&mdash;Landor had sent the
    verses to Forster at the same time as to me, yet they do not appear. I
    never in my life less cared about people's praise or blame for myself,
    and never more for its influence on <i>other people</i> than now&mdash;I would
    stand as high as I could in the eyes of all about you&mdash;yet not, after
    all, at poor Chorley's expense whom your brother, I am sure,
    unintentionally, is rather hasty in condemning; I have told you of my
    own much rasher opinion and how I was ashamed and sorry when I
    corrected it after. C. is of a different species to your brother,
    differently trained, looking different ways&mdash;and for some of the
    peculiarities that strike at first sight, C. himself gives a good
    reason to the enquirer on better acquaintance. For 'Vulgarity'&mdash;NO!
    But your kind brother will alter his view, I know, on further
    acquaintance ... and,&mdash;woe's me&mdash;will find that 'assumption's' pertest
    self would be troubled to exercise its quality at such a house as Mr.
    K.'s, where every symptom of a proper claim is met half way and helped
    onward far too readily.
</p>
<p>
    Good night, now. Am I not yours&mdash;are you not mine? And can that make
    <i>you</i> happy too?
</p>
<p>
    Bless you once more and for ever.
</p>
<p>
    That scrap of Landor's being for no other eye than mine&mdash;I made the
    foolish comment, that there was no blotting out&mdash;made it some four or
    five years ago, when I could read what I only guess at now, through my
    idle opening the hand and letting the caught bird go&mdash;but there used
    to be a real satisfaction to me in writing those grand Hebrew
    characters&mdash;the noble languages!

<p style="text-align: right">Monday.<br>
[Post-mark, November 24, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    But what unlawful things have I said about 'kindness'? I did not mean
    any harm&mdash;no, indeed! And as to thinking ... as to having ever
    thought, that you could 'imitate' (can this word be 'imitate'?) an
    unfelt feeling or a feeling unsupposed to be felt ... I may solemnly
    assure you that I never, never did so. 'Get up'&mdash;'imitate'!! But it
    was the contrary ... <i>all</i> the contrary! From the beginning, now <i>did</i>
    I not believe you too much? Did I not believe you even in your
    contradiction of yourself ... in your <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> on the same
    subject, ... and take the world to be turning round backwards and
    myself to have been shut up here till I grew mad, ... rather than
    disbelieve you either way? Well!&mdash;You know it as well as I can tell
    you, and I will not, any more. If I have been 'wrong,' it was not <i>so</i>
    ... nor indeed <i>then</i> ... it is not <i>so</i>, though it is <i>now</i>, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore ... but wait! I never gave away what you ask me to give
    <i>you</i>, to a human being, except my nearest relatives and once or twice
    or thrice to female friends, ... never, though reproached for it; and
    it is just three weeks since I said last to an asker that I was 'too
    great a prude for such a thing'! it was best to anticipate the
    accusation!&mdash;And, prude or not, I could not&mdash;I never
    could&mdash;<i>something</i> would not let me. And now ... what am I to do ...
    'for my own sake and not yours?' Should you have it, or not? Why I
    suppose ... <i>yes</i>. I suppose that 'for my own sense of justice and in
    order to show that I was wrong' (which is wrong&mdash;you wrote a wrong
    word there ... 'right,' you meant!) 'to show that I was <i>right</i> and am
    no longer so,' ... I suppose you must have it, 'Oh, <i>You</i>,' ... who
    have your way in everything! Which does not mean ... Oh, vous, qui
    avez toujours raison&mdash;far from it.
</p>
<p>
    Also ... which does not mean that I shall give you what you ask for,
    <i>to-morrow</i>,&mdash;because I shall not&mdash;and one of my conditions is (with
    others to follow) that <i>not a word be said to-morrow</i>, you understand.
    Some day I will send it perhaps ... as you <i>knew</i> I should ... ah, as
    you knew I should ... notwithstanding that 'getting up' ... that
    'imitation' ... of humility: as you knew <i>too</i> well I should!
</p>
<p>
    Only I will not teaze you as I might perhaps; and now that your
    headache has begun again&mdash;the headache again: the worse than headache!
    See what good my wishes do! And try to understand that if I speak of
    my being 'wrong' now in relation to you ... of my being right before,
    and wrong now, ... I mean wrong for your sake, and not for mine ...
    wrong in letting you come out into the desert here to me, you whose
    place is by the waters of Damascus. But I need not tell you over
    again&mdash;you <i>know</i>. May God bless you till to-morrow and past it for
    ever. Mr. Kenyon brought me your note yesterday to read about the
    'order in the button-hole'&mdash;ah!&mdash;or 'oh, <i>you</i>,' may I not re-echo? It
    enrages me to think of Mr. Forster; publishing too as he does, at a
    moment, the very sweepings of Landor's desk! Is the motive of the
    reticence to be looked for somewhere among the cinders?&mdash;Too bad it
    is. So, till to-morrow! and you shall not be 'kind' any more.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your</p>

    the prize of Saturday! Oh, dearest, believe for truth's sake, that I

    become yours for ever. God bless you, and make me thankful!

<p style="text-align: right">Monday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, November 27, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Now you must not blame me&mdash;you must not. To make a promise is one
    thing, and to keep it, quite another: and the conclusion you see 'as
    from a tower.' Suppose I had an oath in heaven somewhere ... near to
    'coma Berenices,' ... never to give you what you ask for! ... would
    not such an oath be stronger than a mere half promise such as I sent
    you a few hours ago? Admit that it would&mdash;and that I am not to blame
    for saying now ... (listen!) that I <i>never can</i> nor <i>will give you
    this thing</i>;&mdash;only that I will, if you please, exchange it for another
    thing&mdash;you understand. <i>I</i> too will avoid being 'assuming'; I will not
    pretend to be generous, no, nor 'kind.' It shall be pure merchandise
    or nothing at all. Therefore determine!&mdash;remembering always how our
    'ars poetica,' after Horace, recommends 'dare et petere
    vicissim'&mdash;which is making a clatter of pedantry to take advantage of
    the noise ... because perhaps I ought to be ashamed to say this to
    you, and perhaps I <i>am</i>! ... yet say it none the less.
</p>
<p>
    And ... less lightly ... if you have right and reason on your side,
    may I not have a little on mine too? And shall I not care, do you
    think?... Think!
</p>
<p>
    Then there is another reason for me, entirely mine. You have come to
    me as a dream comes, as the best dreams come ... dearest&mdash;and so there
    is need to me of 'a sign' to know the difference between dream and
    vision&mdash;and <i>that</i> is my completest reason, my own reason&mdash;you have
    none like it; none. A ticket to know the horn-gate from the ivory, ...
    ought I not to have it? Therefore send it to me before I send you
    anything, and if possible by that Lewisham post which was the most
    frequent bringer of your letters until these last few came, and which
    reaches me at eight in the evening when all the world is at dinner and
    my solitude most certain. Everything is so still then, that I have
    heard the footsteps of a letter of yours ten doors off ... or more,
    perhaps. Now beware of imagining from this which I say, that there is
    a strict police for my correspondence ... (it is not so&mdash;) nor that I
    do not like hearing from you at any and every hour: it <i>is</i> so. Only I
    would make the smoothest and sweetest of roads for ... and you
    <i>understand</i>, and do not <i>imagine</i> beyond.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Tuesday evening.</i>&mdash;What is written is written, ... all the above: and
    it is forbidden to me to write a word of what I could write down here
    ... forbidden for good reasons. So I am silent on <i>conditions</i> ...
    those being ... first ... that you never do such things again ... no,
    you must not and shall not.... I <i>will not let it be</i>: and secondly,
    that you try to hear the unspoken words, and understand how your gift
    will remain with me while <i>I</i> remain ... they need not be said&mdash;just
    as <i>it</i> need not have been so beautiful, for that. The beauty drops
    'full fathom five' into the deep thought which covers it. So I study
    my Machiavelli to contrive the possibility of wearing it, without
    being put to the question violently by all the curiosity of all my
    brothers;&mdash;the questions 'how' ... 'what' ... 'why' ... put round and
    edgeways. They are famous, some of them, for asking questions. I say
    to them&mdash;'well: how many more questions?' And now ... for <i>me</i>&mdash;<i>have</i>
    I said a word?&mdash;<i>have</i> I not been obedient? And by rights and in
    justice, there should have been a reproach ... if there could!
    Because, friendship or more than friendship, Pisa or no Pisa, it was
    unnecessary altogether from you to me ... but I have done, and you
    shall not be teazed.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Only ... I persist in the view of the <i>other</i> question.
    This will not do for the '<i>sign</i>,' ... this, which, so far from being
    qualified for disproving a dream, is the beautiful image of a dream in
    itself ... <i>so</i> beautiful: and with the very shut eyelids, and the
    "little folding of the hands to sleep." You see at a glance it will
    not do. And so&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Just as one might be interrupted while telling a fairy-tale, ... in
    the midst of the "and so's" ... just <i>so</i>, I have been interrupted by
    the coming in of Miss Bayley, and here she has been sitting for nearly
    two hours, from twelve to two nearly, and I like her, do you know. Not
    only she talks well, which was only a thing to expect, but she seems
    to <i>feel</i> ... to have great sensibility&mdash;<i>and</i> her kindness to me ...
    kindness of manner and words and expression, all together ... quite
    touched me.&mdash;I did not think of her being so loveable a person. Yet it
    was kind and generous, her proposition about Italy; (did I tell you
    how she made it to me through Mr. Kenyon long ago&mdash;when I was a mere
    stranger to her?) the proposition to go there with me herself. It was
    quite a grave, earnest proposal of hers&mdash;which was one of the reasons
    why I could not even <i>wish</i> not to see her to-day. Because you see, it
    was a tremendous degree of experimental generosity, to think of going
    to Italy by sea with an invalid stranger, "seule <i>à</i> seule." And she
    was wholly in earnest, wholly. Is there not good in the world after
    all?
</p>
<p>
    Tell me how you are, for I am not at ease about you&mdash;You were not well
    even yesterday, I thought. If this goes on ... but it mustn't go
    on&mdash;oh, it must not. May God bless us more!
</p>
<p>
    Do not fancy, in the meantime, that you stay here 'too long' for any
    observation that can be made. In the first place there is nobody to
    'observe'&mdash;everybody is out till seven, except the one or two who will
    not observe if I tell them not. My sisters are glad when you come,
    because it is a gladness of mine, ... they observe. I have a great
    deal of liberty, to have so many chains; we all have, in this house:
    and though the liberty has melancholy motives, it saves some daily
    torment, and <i>I</i> do not complain of it for one.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you! Do not forget me. Say how you are. What good can I
    do you with all my thoughts, when you keep unwell? See!&mdash;Facts are
    against fancies. As when I would not have the lamp lighted yesterday
    because it seemed to make it later, and you proved directly that it
    would not make it <i>earlier</i>, by getting up and going away!

    you!'&mdash;<i>What</i> does that mean, dearest?
</p>
<p>
    And I might have stayed longer and you let me go. What does <i>that</i>
    mean, also tell me? Why, I make up my mind to go, always, like a man,
    and praise myself as I get through it&mdash;as when one plunges into the

<p>
    I would not be ashamed of my soul if it might be shown you,&mdash;it is
    wholly grateful, conscious of you.
</p>

    But another time, do not let me wrong myself <i>so</i>! Say, 'one minute

    Shall I dare write down a grievance of my heart, and not offend you?
    Yes, trusting in the right of my love&mdash;you tell me, sweet, here in the
    letter, 'I do not look so well'&mdash;and sometimes, I 'look better' ...
    <i>how do you know</i>? When I first saw you&mdash;<i>I saw your eyes</i>&mdash;since
    then, <i>you</i>, it should appear, see mine&mdash;but I only <i>know</i> yours are
    there, and have to use that memory as if one carried dried flowers
    about when fairly inside the garden-enclosure. And while I resolve,
    and hesitate, and resolve again to complain of this&mdash;(kissing your
    foot ... not boldly complaining, nor rudely)&mdash;while I have this on my
    mind, on my heart, ever since that May morning ... can it be?

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday.<br>
[Post-mark, December 1, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    It comes at eight o'clock&mdash;the post says eight ... <i>I</i> say nearer half
    past eight ... it <i>comes</i>&mdash;and I thank you, thank you, as I can. Do
    you remember the purple lock of a king on which hung the fate of a
    city? <i>I</i> do! And I need not in conscience&mdash;because this one here did
    not come to me by treason&mdash;'ego et rex meus,' on the contrary, do
    fairly give and take.
</p>
<p>
    I meant at first only to send you what is in the ring ... which, by
    the way, will not fit you I know&mdash;(not certainly in the finger which
    it was meant for ...) as it would not Napoleon before you&mdash;but can
    easily be altered to the right size.... I meant at first to send you
    only what was in the ring: but your fashion is best so you shall have
    it both ways. Now don't say a word on Monday ... nor at all. As for
    the ring, recollect that I am forced to feel blindfold into the outer
    world, and take what is nearest ... by chance, not choice ... or it
    might have been better&mdash;a little better&mdash;perhaps. The <i>best</i> of it is
    that it's the colour of your blue flowers. Now you will not say a
    word&mdash;I trust to you.
</p>
<p>
    It is enough that you should have said these others, I think. Now <i>is</i>
    it just of you? isn't it hard upon me? And if the charge is true,
    whose fault is it, pray? I have been ashamed and vexed with myself
    fifty times for being so like a little girl, ... for seeming to have
    'affectations'; and all in vain: 'it was stronger than I,' as the
    French say. And for <i>you</i> to complain! As if Haroun Alraschid after
    cutting off a head, should complain of the want of an
    obeisance!&mdash;Well!&mdash;I smile notwithstanding. Nobody can help
    smiling&mdash;both for my foolishness which is great, I confess, though
    somewhat exaggerated in your statement&mdash;(because if it was quite as
    bad as you say, you know, I never should have <i>seen you</i> ... and <i>I
    have</i>!) and also for yours ... because you take such a very
    preposterously wrong way for overcoming anybody's shyness. Do you
    know, I have laughed ... really laughed at your letter. No&mdash;it has not
    been so bad. I have seen you at every visit, as well as I could with
    both eyes wide open&mdash;only that by a supernatural influence they won't
    stay open with <i>you</i> as they are used to do with other people ... so
    now I tell you. And for the rest I promise nothing at all&mdash;as how can
    I, when it is quite beyond my control&mdash;and you have not improved my
    capabilities ... do you think you have? Why what nonsense we have come
    to&mdash;we, who ought to be 'talking Greek!' said Mr. Kenyon.
</p>
<p>
    Yes&mdash;he came and talked of you, and told me how you had been speaking
    of ... me; and I have been thinking how I should have been proud of it
    a year ago, and how I could half scold you for it now. Ah yes&mdash;and Mr.
    Kenyon told me that you had spoken exaggerations&mdash;such
    exaggerations!&mdash;Now should there not be some scolding ... some?
</p>
<p>
    But how did you expect Mr. Kenyon to 'wonder' at <i>you</i>, or be 'vexed'
    with <i>you</i>? That would have been strange surely. You are and always
    have been a chief favourite in that quarter ... appreciated, praised,
    loved, I think.
</p>
<p>
    While I write, a letter from America is put into my hands, and having
    read it through with shame and confusion of face ... not able to help
    a smile though notwithstanding, ... I send it to you to show how you
    have made me behave!&mdash;to say nothing of my other offences to the kind
    people at Boston&mdash;and to a stray gentleman in Philadelphia who is to
    perform a pilgrimage next year, he says, ... to visit the Holy Land
    and your E.B.B. I was naughty enough to take <i>that</i> letter to be a
    circular ... for the address of various 'Europ<i>a</i>ians.' In any case
    ... just see how I have behaved! and if it has not been worse than ...
    not opening one's eyes!&mdash;Judge. Really and gravely I am ashamed&mdash;I
    mean as to Mr. Mathews, who has been an earnest, kind friend to
    me&mdash;and I do mean to behave better. I say <i>that</i> to prevent your
    scolding, you know. And think of Mr. Poe, with that great Roman
    justice of his (if not rather American!), dedicating a book to one and
    abusing one in the preface of the same. He wrote a review of me in
    just that spirit&mdash;the two extremes of laudation and reprehension,
    folded in on one another. You would have thought that it had been
    written by a friend and foe, each stark mad with love and hate, and
    writing the alternate paragraphs&mdash;a most curious production indeed.
</p>
<p>
    And here I shall end. I have been waiting ... waiting for what does
    not come ... the ring ... sent to have the hair put in; but it won't
    come (now) until too late for the post, and you must hear from me
    before Monday ... you ought to have heard to-day. It has not been my
    fault&mdash;I have waited. Oh these people&mdash;who won't remember that it is
    possible to be out of patience! So I send you my letter now ... and
    what is in the paper now ... and the rest, you shall have after
    Monday. And you <i>will not say a word</i> ... not then ... not at all!&mdash;I
    trust you. And may God bless you.
</p>
<p>
    If ever you care less for me&mdash;I do not say it in distrust of you ... I
    trust you wholly&mdash;but you are a man, and free to care less, ... and if
    ever you <i>do</i> ... why in that case you will destroy, burn, ... do all
    but send back ... enough is said for you to understand.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. You are <i>best</i> to me&mdash;best ... as I see ... in the
    world&mdash;and so, dearest aright to

<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    Finished on Saturday evening. Oh&mdash;this thread of silk&mdash;And to post!!
    After all you must wait till Tuesday. I have no silk within reach and
    shall miss the post. Do forgive me.
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Evening.
</p>
<p>
    This is the mere postscript to the letter I have just sent away. By a
    few minutes too late, comes what I have all day been waiting for, ...
    and besides (now it is just too late!) now I may have a skein of silk
    if I please, to make that knot with, ... for want of which, two locks
    meant for you, have been devoted to the infernal gods already ...
    fallen into a tangle and thrown into the fire ... and all the hair of
    my head might have followed, for I was losing my patience and temper
    fast, ... and the post to boot. So wisely I shut my letter, (after
    unwisely having driven everything to the last moment!)&mdash;and now I have
    silk to tie fast with ... to tie a 'nodus' ... 'dignus' of the
    celestial interposition&mdash;and a new packet shall be ready to go to you
    directly.
</p>
<p>
    At last I remember to tell you that the first letter you had from me
    this week, was forgotten, (not by <i>me</i>) forgotten, and detained, so,
    from the post&mdash;a piece of carelessness which Wilson came to confess to
    me too frankly for me to grumble as I should have done otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    For the staying longer, I did not mean to say you were wrong not to
    stay. In the first place you were keeping your father 'in a maze,' as
    you said yourself&mdash;and then, even without that, I never know what
    o'clock it is ... never. Mr. Kenyon tells me that I must live in a
    dream&mdash;which I do&mdash;time goes ... seeming to go round rather than go
    forward. The watch I have, broke its spring two years ago, and there I
    leave it in the drawer&mdash;and the clocks all round strike out of
    hearing, or at best, when the wind brings the sound, one upon another
    in a confusion. So you know more of time than I do or can.
</p>
<p>
    Till Monday then! I send the 'Ricordi' to take care of the rest ... of
    mine. It is a touching story&mdash;and there is an impracticable nobleness
    from end to end in the spirit of it. How <i>slow</i> (to the ear and mind)
    that Italian rhetoric is! a language for dreamers and declaimers. Yet
    Dante made it for action, and Machiavelli's prose can walk and strike
    as well as float and faint.
</p>
<p>
    The ring is smaller than I feared at first, and may perhaps&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Now you will not say a word. My excuse is that you had nothing to
    remember me by, while I had this and this and this and this ... how
    much too much!

    See, dearest, what the post brings me this minute! Now, is it not a
    good omen, a pleasant inconscious prophecy of what is to be? Be it
    well done, or badly&mdash;there are you, leading me up and onward, in his
    review as everywhere, at every future time! And our names will go
    together&mdash;be read together. In itself this is nothing to <i>you</i>, dear
    poet&mdash;but the unexpectedness, unintended significance of it has
    pleased me very much&mdash;<i>does</i> it not please you?&mdash;I thought I was to
    figure in that cold <i>Quarterly</i> all by myself, (for he writes for
    it)&mdash;but here you are close by me; it cannot but be for good. He has
    no knowledge whatever that I am even a friend of yours. Say you are
    pleased!
</p>
<p>
    There was no writing yesterday for me&mdash;nor will there be much to-day.
    In some moods, you know, I turn and take a thousand new views of what
    you say ... and find fault with you to your surprise&mdash;at others, I
    rest on you, and feel <i>all</i> well, all <i>best</i> ... now, for one
    instance, even that phrase of the <i>possibility</i> 'and what is to
    follow,'&mdash;even <i>that</i> I cannot except against&mdash;I am happy, contented;
    too well, too prodigally blessed to be even able to murmur just
    sufficiently loud to get, in addition to it all, a sweetest stopping
    of the mouth! I will say quietly and becomingly 'Yes&mdash;I do promise
    you'&mdash;yet it is some solace to&mdash;No&mdash;I will <i>not</i> even couple the
    promise with an adjuration that you, at the same time, see that they
    care for me properly at Hanwell Asylum ... the best by all accounts:
    yet I feel so sure of <i>you</i>, so safe and confident in you! If any of
    it had been <i>my</i> work, my own ... distrust and foreboding had pursued
    me from the beginning; but all is <i>yours</i>&mdash;you crust me round with
    gold and jewelry like the wood of a sceptre; and why should you
    transfer your own work? Wood enough to choose from in the first
    instance, but the choice once made!... So I rest on you, for life, for
    death, beloved&mdash;beside you do stand, in my solemn belief, the direct
    miraculous gift of God to me&mdash;that is my solemn belief; may I be
    thankful!
</p>
<p>
    I am anxious to hear from you ... when am I not?&mdash;but <i>not</i> before the

<p>
    No Mr. Kenyon after all&mdash;not yesterday, not to-day; and the knock at
    the door belonged perhaps to the post, which brought me a kind letter
    from Mrs. Jameson to ask how I was, and if she might come&mdash;but she
    won't come on Saturday.... I shall 'provide'&mdash;she may as well (and
    better) come on a free day. On the other side, are you sure that Mr.
    Procter may not stretch out his hand and seize on Saturday (he was to
    dine with you, you said), or that some new engagement may not start up
    suddenly in the midst of it? I trust to you, in such a case, to alter
    <i>our</i> arrangement, without a second thought. Monday stands close by,
    remember, and there's a Saturday to follow Monday ... and I should
    understand at a word, or apart from a word.
</p>
<p>
    Just as <i>you</i> understand how to 'take me with guile,' when you tell me
    that anything in me can have any part in making you happy ... you, who
    can say such words and call them 'vain words.' Ah, well! If I only
    knew certainly, ... more certainly than the thing may be known by
    either me or you, ... that nothing in me could have any part in making
    you <i>un</i>happy, ... ah, would it not be enough ... <i>that</i> knowledge ...
    to content me, to overjoy me? but <i>that</i> lies too high and out of
    reach, you see, and one can't hope to get at it except by the ladder
    Jacob saw, and which an archangel helped to hide away behind the gate
    of Heaven afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;In the meantime I had a letter from you yesterday, and
    am promised another to-day. How ... I was going to say 'kind' and
    pull down the thunders ... how <i>un</i>kind ... will <i>that</i> do? ... how
    good you are to me&mdash;how dear you must be! Dear&mdash;dearest&mdash;if I feel
    that you love me, can I help it if, without any other sort of certain
    knowledge, the world grows lighter round me? being but a mortal woman,
    can I help it? no&mdash;certainly.
</p>
<p>
    I comfort myself by thinking sometimes that I can at least understand
    you, ... comprehend you in what you are and in what you possess and
    combine; and that, if doing this better than others who are better
    otherwise than I, I am, so far, worthier of the ... I mean that to
    understand you is something, and that I account it something in my own
    favour ... mine.
</p>
<p>
    Yet when you tell me that I ought to know some things, though untold,
    you are wrong, and speak what is impossible. My imagination sits by
    the roadside <span title="apedilos">&alpha;&pi;&epsilon;&delta;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> like the startled sea nymph in
    Æschylus, but never dares to put one unsandalled foot, unbidden, on a
    certain tract of ground&mdash;never takes a step there unled! and never (I
    write the simple truth) even as the alternative of the probability of
    your ceasing to care for me, have I touched (untold) on the
    possibility of your caring <i>more</i> for me ... never! That you should
    <i>continue</i> to care, was the utmost of what I saw in that direction.
    So, when you spoke of a 'strengthened feeling,' judge how I listened
    with my heart&mdash;judge!
</p>
<p>
    'Luria' is very great. You will avenge him with the sympathies of the
    world; that, I foresee.... And for the rest, it is a magnanimity which
    grows and grows, and which will, of a worldly necessity, fall by its
    own weight at last; nothing less being possible. The scene with
    Tiburzio and the end of the act with its great effects, are more
    pathetic than professed pathos. When I come to criticise, it will be
    chiefly on what I take to be a little occasional flatness in the
    versification, which you may remove if you please, by knotting up a
    few lines here and there. But I shall write more of 'Luria,'&mdash;and
    well remember in the meanwhile, that you wanted smoothness, you said.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. I shall have the letter to-night, I think gladly.
    Yes,&mdash;I thought of the greater safety from 'comment'&mdash;it is best in
    every way.

    Why of course I am pleased&mdash;I should have been pleased last year, for

    <i>you</i>,&mdash;oh, of course I am pleased!&mdash;I am pleased that the 'names
    should be read together' as you say, ... and am happily safe from the
    apprehension of that ingenious idea of yours about 'my leading <i>you</i>'
    &amp;c. ... quite happily safe from the apprehension of that idea's
    occurring to any mind in the world, except just your own. Now if I
    'find fault' with you for writing down such an extravagance, such an
    ungainly absurdity, (oh, I shall abuse it just as I shall choose!)
    <i>can</i> it be 'to your surprise?' <i>can</i> it? Ought you to say such
    things, when in the first place they are unfit in themselves and
    inapplicable, and in the second place, abominable in my eyes? The
    qualification for Hanwell Asylum is different peradventure from what
    you take it to be&mdash;we had better not examine it too nearly. You never
    will say such words again? It is your promise to me? Not those
    words&mdash;and not any in their likeness.
</p>
<p>
    Also ... nothing is <i>my</i> work ... if you please! What an omen you take
    in calling anything my work! If it is my work, woe on it&mdash;for
    everything turns to evil which I touch. Let it be God's work and
    yours, and I may take breath and wait in hope&mdash;and indeed I exclaim to
    myself about the miracle of it far more even than you can do. It seems
    to me (as I say over and over ... I say it to my own thoughts
    oftenest) it seems to me still a dream how you came here at all, ...
    the very machinery of it seems miraculous. Why did I receive you and
    only you? Can I tell? no, not a word.
</p>
<p>
    Last year I had such an escape of seeing Mr. Horne; and in this way it
    was. He was going to Germany, he said, for an indefinite time, and
    took the trouble of begging me to receive him for ten minutes before
    he went. I answered with my usual 'no,' like a wild Indian&mdash;whereupon
    he wrote me a letter so expressive of mortification and vexation ...
    'mortification' was one of the words used, I remember, ... that I grew
    ashamed of myself and told him to come any day (of the last five or
    six days he had to spare) between two and five. Well!&mdash;he never came.
    Either he was overcome with work and engagements of various sorts and
    had not a moment, (which was his way of explaining the matter and
    quite true I dare say) or he was vexed and resolved on punishing me
    for my caprices. If the latter was the motive, I cannot call the
    punishment effective, ... for I clapped my hands for joy when I felt
    my danger to be passed&mdash;and now of course, I have no scruples.... I
    may be as capricious as I please, ... may I not? Not that I ask you.
    It is a settled matter. And it is useful to keep out Mr. Chorley with
    Mr. Horne, and Mr. Horne with Mr. Chorley, and the rest of the world
    with those two. Only the miracle is that <i>you</i> should be behind the
    enclosure&mdash;within it ... and so!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    <i>That</i> is <i>my</i> side of the wonder! of the machinery of the wonder, ...
    as <i>I</i> see it!&mdash;But there are greater things than these.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of the portrait of you in the 'Spirit of the Age' ... which
    is not like ... no!&mdash;which has not your character, in a line of it ...
    something in just the forehead and eyes and hair, ... but even <i>that</i>,
    thrown utterly out of your order, by another bearing so unlike you...!
    speaking of that portrait ... shall I tell you?&mdash;Mr. Horne had the
    goodness to send me all those portraits, and I selected the heads
    which, in right hero-worship, were anything to me, and had them framed
    after a rough fashion and hung up before my eyes; Harriet Martineau's
    ... because she was a woman and admirable, and had written me some
    kind letters&mdash;and for the rest, Wordsworth's, Carlyle's, Tennyson's
    and yours. The day you paid your first visit here, I, in a fit of
    shyness not quite unnatural, ... though I have been cordially laughed
    at for it by everybody in the house ... pulled down your portrait, ...
    (there is the nail, under Wordsworth&mdash;) and then pulled down
    Tennyson's in a fit of justice,&mdash;because I would not have his hung up
    and yours away. It was the delight of my brothers to open all the
    drawers and the boxes, and whatever they could get access to, and find
    and take those two heads and hang them on the old nails and analyse my
    'absurdity' to me, day after day; but at last I tired them out, being
    obstinate; and finally settled the question one morning by fastening
    the print of you inside your Paracelsus. Oh no, it is not like&mdash;and I
    knew it was not, before I saw you, though Mr. Kenyon said, 'Rather
    like!'
</p>
<p>
    By the way Mr. Kenyon does not come. It is strange that he should not
    come: when he told me that he could not see me 'for a week or a
    fortnight,' he meant it, I suppose.
</p>
<p>
    So it is to be on Saturday? And I will write directly to America&mdash;the
    letter will be sent by the time you get this. May God bless you ever.
</p>
<p>
    It is not so much a look of 'ferocity,' ... as you say, ... in that
    head, as of <i>expression by intention</i>. Several people have said of it
    what nobody would say of you ... 'How affected-looking.' Which is too
    strong&mdash;but it is not like you, in any way, and there's the truth.
</p>
<p>
    So until Saturday. I read 'Luria' and feel the life in him. But <i>walk</i>
    and do not <i>work</i>! do you?

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Night.<br>
[Post-mark, December 8, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Well, I did see your brother last night ... and very wisely neither
    spoke nor kept silence in the proper degree, but said that 'I hoped
    you were well'&mdash;from the sudden feeling that I must say <i>something</i> of
    you&mdash;not pretend indifference about you <i>now</i> ... and from the
    impossibility of saying the <i>full</i> of what I might; because other
    people were by&mdash;and after, in the evening, when I should have remedied
    the first imperfect expression, I had not altogether the heart. So,
    you, dearest, will clear me with him if he wonders, will you not? But
    it all hangs together; speaking of you,&mdash;to you,&mdash;writing to you&mdash;all
    is helpless and sorrowful work by the side of what is in my soul to
    say and to write&mdash;or is it not the natural consequence? If these
    vehicles of feelings sufficed&mdash;<i>there</i> would be the end!&mdash;And that my
    feeling for you should end!... For the rest, the headache which kept
    away while I sate with you, made itself amends afterward, and as it is
    unkind to that warm Talfourd to look blank at his hospitable
    endeavours, all my power of face went <i>à qui de droit</i>&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Did your brother tell you ... yes, I think ... of the portentous book,
    lettered II, and thick as a law-book, of congratulatory letters on
    the appearance of 'Ion'?&mdash;But how under the B's in the Index came
    'Miss Barrett' and, woe's me, 'R.B.'! I don't know when I have had so
    ghastly a visitation. There was the utterly <i>forgotten</i> letter, in the
    as thoroughly disused hand-writing, in the ... I fear ... still as
    completely obsolete feeling&mdash;no, not so bad as that&mdash;but at first
    there was all the novelty, and social admiration at the friend&mdash;it is
    truly not right to pluck all the rich soil from the roots and hold
    them up clean and dry as if they came <i>so</i> from all you now see, which
    is nothing at all ... like the Chinese Air-plant! Do you understand
    this? And surely 'Ion' is a <i>very</i>, very beautiful and noble
    conception, and finely executed,&mdash;a beautiful work&mdash;what has come
    after, has lowered it down by grade after grade ... it don't stand
    apart on the hill, like a wonder, now it is <i>built up</i> to by other
    attempts; but the great difference is in myself. Another maker of
    another 'Ion,' finding me out and behaving as Talfourd did, would not
    find <i>that me</i>, so to be behaved to, so to be honoured&mdash;though he
    should have all the good will! Ten years ago!
</p>
<p>
    And ten years hence!
</p>
<p>
    Always understand that you do <i>not</i> take me as I was at the beginning
    ... with a crowd of loves to give to <i>something</i> and so get rid of
    their pain and burden. I have <i>known</i> what that ends in&mdash;a handful of
    anything may be as sufficient a sample, serve your purposes and teach
    you its nature, as well as whole heaps&mdash;and I know what most of the
    pleasures of this world are&mdash;so that I <i>can</i> be surer of myself, and
    make you surer, on calm demonstrated grounds, than if I had a host of
    objects of admiration or ambition <i>yet</i> to become acquainted with. You
    say, 'I am a man and may change'&mdash;I answer, yes&mdash;but, while I hold my
    senses, only change for the <i>presumable</i> better ... not for the
    <i>experienced worst</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Here is my Uncle's foot on the stair ... his knock hurried the last
    sentence&mdash;here he is by me!&mdash;Understand what this would have led to,
    how you would have been <i>proved logically</i> my own, best, extreme want,
    my life's end&mdash;<SPAN class="sc-ex">yes</span>; dearest! Bless you ever&mdash;

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, December 8, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Let me hear how you are, and that you are better instead of worse for
    the exertions of last night. After you left me yesterday I considered
    how we might have managed it more conveniently for you, and had the
    lamp in, and arranged matters so as to interpose less time between the
    going and the dining, even if you and George did not go together,
    which might have been best, but which I did not like quite to propose.
    Now, supposing that on Thursday you dine in town, remember not to be
    unnecessarily 'perplext in the extreme' where to spend the time before
    ... <i>five</i>, ... shall I say, at any rate? We will have the lamp, and I
    can easily explain if an observation should be made ... only it will
    not be, because our goers-out here never come home until six, and the
    head of the house, not until seven ... as I told you. George thought
    it worth while going to Mr. Talfourd's yesterday, just to see the
    author of 'Paracelsus' dance the Polka ... should I not tell you?
</p>
<p>
    I am vexed by another thing which he tells <i>me</i>&mdash;vexed, if amused a
    little by the absurdity of it. I mean that absurd affair of the
    'Autography'&mdash;now <i>isn't</i> it absurd? And for neither you nor George to
    have the chivalry of tearing out that letter of mine, which was absurd
    too in its way, and which, knowing less of the world than I know now,
    I wrote as if writing for my private conscience, and privately
    repented writing in a day, and have gone on repenting ever since when
    I happened to think enough of it for repentance! Because if Mr.
    Serjeant Talfourd sent then his 'Ion' to <i>me</i>, he did it in mere
    good-nature, hearing by chance of me through the publisher of my
    'Prometheus' at the moment, and of course caring no more for my
    'opinion' than for the rest of me&mdash;and it was excessively bad taste in
    me to say more than the briefest word of thanks in return, even if I
    had been competent to say it. Ah well!&mdash;you see how it is, and that I
    am vexed <i>you</i> should have read it, ... as George says you did ... he
    laughing to see me so vexed. So I turn round and avenge myself by
    crying aloud against the editor of the 'Autography'! Surely such a
    thing was never done before ... even by an author in the last stage of
    a mortal disease of self-love. To edit the common parlance of
    conventional flatteries, ... lettered in so many volumes, bound in
    green morocco, and laid on the drawing-room table for one's own
    particular private public,&mdash;is it not a miracle of vanity ... neither
    more nor less?
</p>
<p>
    I took the opportunity of the letter to Mr. Mathews (talking of vanity
    ... <i>mine</i>!) to send Landor's verses to America ... yours&mdash;so they
    will be in the American papers.... I know Mr. Mathews. I was speaking
    to him of your last number of 'Bells and Pomegranates,' and the verses
    came in naturally; just as my speaking did, for it is not the first
    time nor the second nor the third even that I have written to him of
    you, though I admire how in all those previous times I did it in pure
    disinterestedness, ... purely because your name belonged to my country
    and to her literature, ... and how I have a sort of reward at this
    present, in being able to write what I please without anyone's saying
    'it is a new fancy.' As for the Americans, they have 'a zeal without
    knowledge' for poetry. There is more love for <i>verse</i> among them than
    among the English. But they suffer themselves to be led in their
    choice of poets by English critics of average discernment; this is
    said of them by their own men of letters. Tennyson is idolized deep
    down in the bush woods (to their honour be it said), but to
    understand <i>you</i> sufficiently, they wait for the explanations of the
    critics. So I wanted them to see what Landor says of you. The comfort
    in these questions is, that there can be <i>no</i> question, except between
    the sooner and the later&mdash;a little sooner, and a little later: but
    when there is real love and zeal it becomes worth while to try to
    ripen the knowledge. They love Tennyson so much that the colour of his
    waistcoats is a sort of minor Oregon question ... and I like that&mdash;do
    not <i>you</i>?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Now I have your letter: and you will observe, without a
    finger post from me, how busily we have both been preoccupied in
    disavowing our own letters of old on 'Ion'&mdash;Mr. Talfourd's collection
    goes to prove too much, I think&mdash;and you, a little too much, when you
    draw inferences of no-changes, from changes like these. Oh yes&mdash;I
    perfectly understand that every sort of inconstancy of purpose regards
    a 'presumably better' thing&mdash;but I do not so well understand how any
    presumable doubt is to be set to rest by that fact, ... I do not
    indeed. Have you seen all the birds and beasts in the world? have you
    seen the 'unicorns'?&mdash;Which is only a pebble thrown down into your
    smooth logic; and we need not stand by to watch the bubbles born of
    it. And as to the 'Ion' letters, I am delighted that you have anything
    to repent, as I have everything. Certainly it is a noble play&mdash;there
    is the moral sublime in it: but it is not the work of a poet, ... and
    if he had never written another to show what was <i>not</i> in him, this
    might have been 'predicated' of it as surely, I hold. Still, it is a
    noble work&mdash;and even if you over-praised it, (I did not read your
    letter, though you read mine, alas!) you, under the circumstances,
    would have been less noble yourself not to have done so&mdash;only, how I
    agree with you in what you say against the hanging up of these dry
    roots, the soil shaken off! Such abominable taste&mdash;now isn't it? ...
    though you do not use that word.
</p>
<p>
    I thought Mr. Kenyon would have come yesterday and that I might have
    something to tell you, of him at least.
</p>
<p>
    And George never told me of the thing you found to say to him of me,
    and which makes me smile, and would have made him wonder if he had not
    been suffering probably from some legal distraction at the moment,
    inasmuch as <i>he knew perfectly that you had just left me</i>. My sisters
    told him down-stairs and he came into this room just before he set off
    on Saturday, with a, ... '<i>So</i> I am to meet Mr. Browning?' But he made
    no observation afterwards&mdash;none: and if he heard what you said at all
    (which I doubt), he referred it probably to some enforced civility on
    'Yorick's' part when the 'last chapter' was too much with him.
</p>
<p>
    I have written about 'Luria' in another place&mdash;you shall have the
    papers when I have read through the play. How different this living
    poetry is from the polished rhetoric of 'Ion.' The man and the statue
    are not more different. After all poetry is a distinct thing&mdash;it is
    here or it is not here ... it is not a matter of '<i>taste</i>,' but of
    sight and feeling.
</p>
<p>
    As to the 'Venice' it gives proof (does it not?) rather of poetical
    sensibility than of poetical faculty? or did you expect me to say
    more?&mdash;of the perception of the poet, rather than of his conception.
    Do you think more than this? There are fine, eloquent expressions, and
    the tone of sentiment is good and high everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    Do not write 'Luria' if your head is uneasy&mdash;and you cannot say that
    it is not ... can you? Or will you if you can? In any case you will do
    what you can ... take care of yourself and not suffer yourself to be
    tired either by writing or by too much going out, and take the
    necessary exercise ... this, you will do&mdash;I entreat you to do it.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless and make you happy, as ... you will lose nothing if I
    say ... as I am yours&mdash;
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, December 9, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Well, then, I am no longer sorry that I did <i>not</i> read <i>either</i> of
    your letters ... for there were two in the collection. I did not read
    one word of them&mdash;and hear why. When your brother and I took the book
    between us in wonderment at the notion&mdash;we turned to the index, in
    large text-hand, and stopped at 'Miss B.'&mdash;and <i>he</i> indeed read them,
    or some of them, but holding the volume at a distance which defied my
    short-sighted eye&mdash;all <i>I</i> saw was the <i>faint</i> small characters&mdash;and,
    do you know ... I neither trusted myself to ask a nearer look ... nor
    a second look ... as if I were studying unduly what I had just said
    was most unfairly exposed to view!&mdash;so I was silent, and lost you (in
    that)&mdash;then, and for ever, I promise you, now that you speak of
    vexation it would give you. <i>All</i> I know of the notes, that <i>one</i> is
    addressed to Talfourd in the third person&mdash;and when I had run through
    my own ... not far off ... (BA-BR)&mdash;I was sick of the book altogether.
    You are generous to me&mdash;but, to say the truth, I might have remembered
    the most justifying circumstance in my case ... which was, that my own
    'Paracelsus,' printed a few months before, had been as dead a failure
    as 'Ion' a brilliant success&mdash;for, until just before.... Ah, really I
    forget!&mdash;but I know that until Forster's notice in the <i>Examiner</i>
    appeared, <i>every</i> journal that thought worth while to allude to the
    poem at all, treated it with entire contempt ... beginning, I think,
    with the <i>Athenæum</i> which <i>then</i> made haste to say, a few days after
    its publication, 'that it was not without talent but spoiled by
    obscurity and only an imitation of&mdash;Shelley'!&mdash;something to this
    effect, in a criticism of about three lines among their 'Library
    Table' notices. And that first taste was a most flattering sample of
    what the 'craft' had in store for me&mdash;since my publisher and I had
    fairly to laugh at <i>his</i> 'Book'&mdash;(quite of another kind than the
    Serjeant's)&mdash;in which he was used to paste extracts from newspapers
    and the like&mdash;seeing that, out of a long string of notices, one vied
    with its predecessor in disgust at my 'rubbish,' as their word went:
    but Forster's notice altered a good deal&mdash;which I have to recollect
    for his good. Still, the contrast between myself and Talfourd was so
    <i>utter</i>&mdash;you remember the world's-wonder 'Ion' made,&mdash;that I was
    determined not to pass for the curious piece of neglected merit I
    really <i>was not</i>&mdash;and so!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But, dearest, why should you leave your own especial sphere of doing
    me good for another than yours?
</p>
<p>
    Does the sun rake and hoe about the garden as well as thine steadily
    over it? <i>Why</i> must you, who give me heart and power, as nothing else
    did or could, to do well&mdash;concern yourself with what might be done by
    any good, kind ministrant <i>only</i> fit for such offices? Not that I
    <i>feel</i>, even, more bound to you for them&mdash;they have their weight, I
    <i>know</i> ... but <i>what</i> weight beside the divine gift of yourself? Do
    not, dear, dearest, care for making me known: <i>you</i> know me!&mdash;and
    <i>they</i> know so little, after all your endeavour, who are ignorant of
    what <i>you</i> are to me&mdash;if you ... well, but that <i>will</i> follow; if I do
    greater things one day&mdash;what shall they serve for, what range
    themselves under of right?&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Mathews sent me two copies of his poems&mdash;and, I believe, a
    newspaper, 'when time was,' about the 'Blot in the Scutcheon'&mdash;and
    also, through Moxon&mdash;(I <i>believe</i> it was Mr. M.)&mdash;a proposition for
    reprinting&mdash;to which I assented of course&mdash;and there was an end to the
    matter.
</p>
<p>
    And might I have stayed <i>till five</i>?&mdash;dearest, I will never ask for
    more than you give&mdash;but I feel every single sand of the gold showers
    ... spite of what I say above! I <i>have</i> an invitation for Thursday
    which I had no intention of remembering (it admitted of such
    liberty)&mdash;but <i>now</i>....
</p>
<p>
    Something I will <i>say</i>! 'Polka,' forsooth!&mdash;one lady whose <i>head</i>
    could not, and another whose feet could not, dance!&mdash;But I talked a
    little to your brother whom I like more and more: it comforts me that
    he is yours.
</p>
<p>
    So, <i>Thursday</i>,&mdash;thank you from the heart! I am well, and about to go
    out. This week I have done nothing to 'Luria'&mdash;is it that my <i>ring</i> is
    gone? There surely <i>is</i> something to forgive in me&mdash;for that shameful
    business&mdash;or I should not feel as I do in the matter: but you <i>did</i>
    forgive me.

    shape&mdash;cut, I fancy, out of church-plate in troubled times. What did
    my friend do but get ready a box, lined with velvet, and properly
    <i>compartmented</i>, to have always about him, so that the <i>next such coin
    he picked</i> up, say in Cheapside, he might at once transfer to a place
    of safety ... his waistcoat pocket being no happy receptacle for the

<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Evening<br>
[Post-mark, December 10, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    It was right of you to write ... (now see what jangling comes of not
    using the fit words.... I said 'right,' not to say 'kind') ... right
    of you to write to me to-day&mdash;and I had begun to be disappointed
    already because the post <i>seemed</i> to be past, when suddenly the knock
    brought the letter which deserves all this praising. If not 'kind' ...
    then <i>kindest</i> ... will that do better? Perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon was here to-day and asked when you were coming again&mdash;and
    I, I answered at random ... 'at the end of the week&mdash;Thursday or
    Friday'&mdash;which did not prevent another question about 'what we were
    consulting about.' He said that he 'must have you,' and had written to
    beg you to go to his door on days when you came here; only murmuring
    something besides of neither Thursday nor Friday being disengaged days
    with him. Oh, my disingenuousness!&mdash;Then he talked again of 'Saul.' A
    true impression the poem has made on him! He reads it every night, he
    says, when he comes home and just before he goes to sleep, to put his
    dreams into order, and observed very aptly, I thought, that it
    reminded him of Homer's shield of Achilles, thrown into lyrical whirl
    and life. Quite ill he took it of me the 'not expecting him to like it
    so much' and retorted on me with most undeserved severity (as I felt
    it), that I 'never understood anybody to have any sensibility except
    myself.' Wasn't it severe, to come from dear Mr. Kenyon? But he has
    caught some sort of evil spirit from your 'Saul' perhaps; though
    admiring the poem enough to have a good spirit instead. And do <i>you</i>
    remember of the said poem, that it is there only as a first part, and
    that the next parts must certainly follow and complete what will be a
    great lyrical work&mdash;now remember. And forget 'Luria' ... if you are
    better forgetting. And forget <i>me</i> ... <i>when</i> you are happier
    forgetting. I say <i>that</i> too.
</p>
<p>
    So your idea of an unicorn is&mdash;one horn broken off. And you a
    poet!&mdash;one horn broken off&mdash;or hid in the blackthorn hedge!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Such a mistake, as our enlightened public, on their part, made, when
    they magnified the divinity of the brazen chariot, just under the
    thunder-cloud! I don't remember the <i>Athenæum</i>, but can well believe
    that it said what you say. The <i>Athenæum</i> admires only what gods, men
    and columns reject. It applauds nothing but mediocrity&mdash;mark it, as a
    general rule! The good, they see&mdash;the great escapes them. Dare to
    breathe a breath above the close, flat conventions of literature, and
    you are 'put down' and instructed how to be like other people. By the
    way, see by the very last number, that you never think to write
    'peoples,' on pain of writing what is obsolete&mdash;and these the teachers
    of the public! If the public does not learn, where is the marvel of
    it? An imitation of Shelley!&mdash;when if 'Paracelsus' was anything it was
    the expression of a new mind, as all might see&mdash;as <i>I</i> saw, let me be
    proud to remember, and I was not overdazzled by 'Ion.'
</p>
<p>
    Ah, indeed if I could 'rake and hoe' ... or even pick up weeds along
    the walk, ... which is the work of the most helpless children, ... if
    I could do any of this, there would be some good of me: but as for
    'shining' ... shining ... when there is not so much light in me as to
    do 'carpet work' by, why let anyone in the world, <i>except you</i>, tell
    me to shine, and it will just be a mockery! But you have studied
    astronomy with your favourite snails, who are apt to take a
    dark-lanthorn for the sun, and so.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And so, you come on Thursday, and I only hope that Mrs. Jameson will
    not come too, (the carpet work makes me think of her; and, not having
    come yet, she may come on Thursday by a fatal cross-stitch!) for I do
    not hear from her, and my precautions are 'watched out,' May God bless
    you always.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your own&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But no&mdash;I did not forgive. Where was the fault to be forgiven, except
    in <i>me</i>, for not being right in my meaning?

</p>
<p>
    And now, my heart's love, I am waiting to hear from you; my heart is
    <i>full</i> of you. When I try to remember what I said yesterday, <i>that</i>
    thought, of what fills my heart&mdash;only <i>that</i> makes me bear with the
    memory.... I know that even such imperfect, poorest of words <i>must</i>
    have come <i>from</i> thence if not bearing up to you all that is
    there&mdash;and I know you are ever above me to receive, and help, and
    forgive, and <i>wait</i> for the one day which I will never say to myself
    cannot come, when I shall speak what I feel&mdash;more of it&mdash;or <i>some</i> of
    it&mdash;for now nothing is spoken.
</p>
<p>
    My all-beloved&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Ah, you opposed very rightly, I dare say, the writing that paper I
    spoke of! The process should be so much simpler! I most earnestly
    <i>expect</i> of you, my love, that in the event of any such necessity as
    was then alluded to, you accept at once in my name <i>any</i> conditions
    possible for a human will to submit to&mdash;there is no imaginable
    condition to which you allow me to accede that I will not joyfully
    bend all my faculties to comply with. And you know this&mdash;but so, also
    do you know <i>more</i> ... and yet 'I may tire of you'&mdash;'may forget you'!
</p>
<p>
    I will write again, having the long, long week to wait! And one of the
    things I must say, will be, that with my love, I cannot lose my pride
    in you&mdash;that nothing <i>but</i> that love could balance that pride&mdash;and
    that, blessing the love so divinely, you must minister to the pride as
    well; yes, my own&mdash;I shall follow your fame,&mdash;and, better than fame,
    the good you do&mdash;in the world&mdash;and, if you please, it shall all be
    mine&mdash;as your hand, as your eyes&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I will write and pray it from you into a promise ... and your promises
    I live upon.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you! your R.B.

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday.<br>
[Post-mark, December 13, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Do not blame me in your thoughts for what I said yesterday or wrote a
    day before, or think perhaps on the dark side of some other days when
    I cannot help it ... always when I cannot help it&mdash;you could not
    blame me if you saw the full motives as I feel them. If it is
    distrust, it is not of <i>you</i>, dearest of all!&mdash;but of myself
    rather:&mdash;it is not doubt <i>of</i> you, but <i>for</i> you. From the beginning I
    have been subject to the too reasonable fear which rises as my spirits
    fall, that your happiness might suffer in the end through your having
    known me:&mdash;it is for <i>you</i> I fear, whenever I fear:&mdash;and if you were
    less to me, ... <i>should</i> I fear do you think?&mdash;if you were to me only
    what I am to myself for instance, ... if your happiness were only as
    precious as my own in my own eyes, ... should I fear, do you think,
    <i>then</i>? Think, and do not blame me.
</p>
<p>
    To tell you to 'forget me when forgetting seemed happiest for you,'
    ... (was it not <i>that</i>, I said?) proved more affection than might go
    in smoother words.... I could prove the truth of <i>that</i> out of my
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    And for the rest, you need not fear any fear of mine&mdash;my fear will not
    cross a wish of yours, be sure! Neither does it prevent your being all
    to me ... all: more than I used to take for all when I looked round
    the world, ... almost more than I took for all in my earliest dreams.
    You stand in between me and not merely the living who stood closest,
    but between me and the closer graves, ... and I reproach myself for
    this sometimes, and, so, ask you not to blame me for a different
    thing.
</p>
<p>
    As to unfavourable influences, ... I can speak of them quietly, having
    foreseen them from the first, ... and it is true, I have been thinking
    since yesterday, that I might be prevented from receiving you here,
    and <i>should</i>, if all were known: but with that act, the adverse power
    would end. It is not my fault if I have to choose between two
    affections; only my pain; and I have not to choose between two duties,
    I feel, ... since I am yours, while I am of any worth to you at all.
    For the plan of the sealed letter, it would correct no evil,&mdash;ah, you
    do not see, you do not understand. The danger does not come from the
    side to which a reason may go. Only one person holds the thunder&mdash;and
    I shall be thundered at; I shall not be reasoned with&mdash;it is
    impossible. I could tell you some dreary chronicles made for laughing
    and crying over; and you know that if I once thought I might be loved
    enough to be spared above others, I cannot think so now. In the
    meanwhile we need not for the present be afraid. Let there be ever so
    many suspectors, there will be no informers. I suspect the suspectors,
    but the informers are out of the world, I am very sure:&mdash;and then, the
    one person, by a curious anomaly, <i>never</i> draws an inference of this
    order, until the bare blade of it is thrust palpably into his hand,
    point outwards. So it has been in other cases than ours&mdash;and so it is,
    at this moment in the house, with others than ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    I have your letter to stop me. If I had my whole life in my hands with
    your letter, could I thank you for it, I wonder, at all worthily? I
    cannot believe that I could. Yet in life and in death I shall be
    grateful to you.&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But for the paper&mdash;no. Now, observe, that it would seem like a
    prepared apology for something wrong. And besides&mdash;the apology would
    be nothing but the offence in another form&mdash;unless you said it was all
    a mistake&mdash;(<i>will</i> you, again?)&mdash;that it was all a mistake and you
    were only calling for your boots! Well, if you said <i>that</i>, it would
    be worth writing, but anything less would be something worse than
    nothing: and would not save me&mdash;which you were thinking of, I
    know&mdash;would not save me the least of the stripes. For
    'conditions'&mdash;now I will tell you what I said once in a jest....
</p>
<p>
    'If a prince of Eldorado should come, with a pedigree of lineal
    descent from some signory in the moon in one hand, and a ticket of
    good-behaviour from the nearest Independent chapel, in the other'&mdash;?
</p>
<p>
    'Why even <i>then</i>,' said my sister Arabel, 'it would not <i>do</i>.' And she
    was right, and we all agreed that she was right. It is an obliquity of
    the will&mdash;and one laughs at it till the turn comes for crying. Poor
    Henrietta has suffered silently, with that softest of possible
    natures, which hers is indeed; beginning with implicit obedience, and
    ending with something as unlike it as possible: but, you see, where
    money is wanted, and where the dependence is total&mdash;see! And when
    once, in the case of the one dearest to me; when just at the last he
    was involved in the same grief, and I attempted to make over my
    advantages to him; (it could be no sacrifice, you know&mdash;<i>I</i> did not
    want the money, and could buy nothing with it so good as his
    happiness,&mdash;) why then, my hands were seized and tied&mdash;and then and
    there, in the midst of the trouble, came the end of all! I tell you
    all this, just to make you understand a little. Did I not tell you
    before? But there is no danger at present&mdash;and why ruffle this present
    with disquieting thoughts? Why not leave that future to itself? For
    me, I sit in the track of the avalanche quite calmly ... so calmly as
    to surprise myself at intervals&mdash;and yet I know the reason of the
    calmness well.
</p>
<p>
    For Mr. Kenyon&mdash;dear Mr. Kenyon&mdash;he will speak the softest of words,
    if any&mdash;only he will think privately that you are foolish and that I
    am ungenerous, but I will not say so any more now, so as to teaze you.
</p>
<p>
    There is another thing, of more consequence than <i>his</i> thoughts, which
    is often in my mind to ask you of&mdash;but there will be time for such
    questions&mdash;let us leave the winter to its own peace. If I should be
    ill again you will be reasonable and we both must submit to God's
    necessity. Not, you know, that I have the least intention of being
    ill, if I can help it&mdash;and in the case of a tolerably mild winter, and
    with all this strength to use, there are probabilities for me&mdash;and
    then I have sunshine from <i>you</i>, which is better than Pisa's.
</p>
<p>
    And what more would you say? Do I not hear and understand! It seems to
    me that I do both, or why all this wonder and gratitude? If the
    devotion of the remainder of my life could prove that I hear, ...
    would it be proof enough? Proof enough perhaps&mdash;but not gift enough.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you always.
</p>
<p>
    I have put <i>some</i> of the hair into a little locket which was given to
    me when I was a child by my favourite uncle, Papa's only brother, who
    used to tell me that he loved me better than my own father did, and
    was jealous when I was not glad. It is through him in part, that I am
    richer than my sisters&mdash;through him and his mother&mdash;and a great grief
    it was and trial, when he died a few years ago in Jamaica, proving by
    his last act that I was unforgotten. And now I remember how he once
    said to me: 'Do you beware of ever loving!&mdash;If you do, you will not do
    it half: it will be for life and death.'
</p>
<p>
    So I put the hair into his locket, which I wear habitually, and which
    never had hair before&mdash;the natural use of it being for perfume:&mdash;and
    this is the best perfume for all hours, besides the completing of a
    prophecy.

    After all, it seems probable that there was no intentional mischief in

    been exposed to fire&mdash;heated thoroughly, perhaps,&mdash;and what became of
    the contents then! Well, all is safe now, and I go to work again of
    course. My next act is just done&mdash;that is, <i>being</i> done&mdash;but, what I
    did not foresee, I cannot bring it, copied, by Wednesday, as my sister
    went this morning on a visit for the week.

    On the matters, the others, I will not think, as you bid me,&mdash;if I can
    help, at least. But your kind, gentle, good sisters! and the provoking

    itself and its plain purpose&mdash;and meanwhile, the real tragedy and
    sacrifice of a life!

<p>
    If you should see Mr. Kenyon, and can find if he will be disengaged on
    Wednesday evening, I shall be glad to go in that case.

<p>
    But I have been writing, as I say, and will leave off this, for the

<p>
    Mr. Kenyon has not come&mdash;he does not come so often, I think. Did he
    <i>know</i> from <i>you</i> that you were to see me last Thursday? If he did it
    might be as well, do you not think? to go to him next week. Will it
    not seem frequent, otherwise? But if you did <i>not</i> tell him of
    Thursday distinctly (<i>I</i> did not&mdash;remember!), he might take the
    Wednesday's visit to be the substitute for rather than the successor
    of Thursday's: and in that case, why not write a word to him yourself
    to propose dining with him as he suggested? He really wishes to see
    you&mdash;of that, I am sure. But you will know what is best to do, and he
    may come here to-morrow perhaps, and ask a whole set of questions
    about you; so my right hand may forget its cunning for any good it
    does. Only don't send messages by <i>me</i>, please!
</p>
<p>
    How happy I am with your letter to-night.
</p>
<p>
    When I had sent away my last letter I began to remember, and could not
    help smiling to do so, that I had totally forgotten the great subject
    of my 'fame,' and the oath you administered about it&mdash;totally! Now how
    do you read that omen? If I forget myself, who is to remember me, do
    you think?&mdash;except <i>you</i>?&mdash;which brings me where I would stay.
    Yes&mdash;'yours' it must be, but <i>you</i>, it had better be! But, to leave
    the vain superstitions, let me go on to assure you that I did mean to
    answer that part of your former letter, and do mean to behave well and
    be obedient. Your wish would be enough, even if there could be
    likelihood without it of my doing nothing ever again. Oh, certainly I
    have been idle&mdash;it comes of lotus-eating&mdash;and, besides, of sitting too
    long in the sun. Yet 'idle' may not be the word! silent I have been,
    through too many thoughts to speak just <i>that</i>!&mdash;As to writing letters
    and reading manuscripts' filling all my time, why I must lack 'vital
    energy' indeed&mdash;you do not mean seriously to fancy such a thing of me!
    For the rest.... Tell me&mdash;Is it your opinion that when the apostle
    Paul saw the unspeakable things, being snatched up into the third
    Heavens 'whether in the body or out of the body he could not
    tell,'&mdash;is it your opinion that, all the week after, he worked
    particularly hard at the tent-making? For my part, I doubt it.
</p>
<p>
    I would not speak profanely or extravagantly&mdash;it is not the best way
    to thank God. But to say only that I was in the desert and that I am
    among the palm-trees, is to say nothing ... because it is easy to
    <i>understand how</i>, after walking straight on ... on ... furlong after
    furlong ... dreary day after dreary day, ... one may come to the end
    of the sand and within sight of the fountain:&mdash;there is nothing
    miraculous in <i>that</i>, you know!
</p>
<p>
    Yet even in that case, to doubt whether it may not all be <i>mirage</i>,
    would be the natural first thought, the recurring dream-fear! now
    would it not? And you can reproach me for <i>my</i> thoughts, as if <i>they</i>
    were unnatural!
</p>
<p>
    Never mind about the third act&mdash;the advantage is that you will not
    tire yourself perhaps the next week. What gladness it is that you
    should really seem better, and how much better <i>that</i> is than even
    'Luria.'

</p>
<p>
    I ought to have written yesterday: so to-day when I need a letter and
    get none, there is my own fault besides, and the less consolation. A
    letter from you would light up this sad day. Shall I fancy how, if a
    letter lay <i>there</i> where I look, rain might fall and winds blow while
    I listened to you, long after the <i>words</i> had been laid to heart? But
    here you are in your place&mdash;with me who am your own&mdash;your own&mdash;and so
    the rhyme joins on,
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">She shall speak to me in places lone<br>
With a low and holy tone&mdash;<br>
Ay: when I have lit my lamp at night<br>
She shall be present with my sprite:<br>
And I will say, whate'er it be,<br>
Every word she telleth me!
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Now, is that taken from your book? No&mdash;but from <i>my</i> book, which holds
    my verses as I write them; and as I open it, I read that.
</p>
<p>
    And speaking of verse&mdash;somebody gave me a few days ago that Mr.
    Lowell's book you once mentioned to me. Anyone who 'admires' <i>you</i>
    shall have my sympathy at once&mdash;even though he <i>do</i> change the
    laughing wine-<i>mark</i> into a 'stain' in that perfectly beautiful
    triplet&mdash;nor am I to be indifferent to his good word for myself
    (though not very happily connected with the criticism on the epithet
    in that 'Yorkshire Tragedy'&mdash;which has better things, by the
    way&mdash;seeing that 'white boy,' in old language, meant just 'good boy,'
    a general epithet, as Johnson notices in the life of Dryden, whom the
    schoolmaster Busby was used to class with his 'white boys'&mdash;this is
    hypercriticism, however). But these American books should not be
    reprinted here&mdash;one asks, what and where is the class to which they
    address themselves? for, no doubt, we have our congregations of
    ignoramuses that enjoy the profoundest ignorance imaginable on the
    subjects treated of; but <i>these</i> are evidently not the audience Mr.
    Lowell reckons on; rather, if one may trust the manner of his setting
    to work, he would propound his doctrine to the class. Always to be
    found, of spirits instructed up to a certain height and there
    resting&mdash;vines that run up a prop and there tangle and grow to a
    knot&mdash;which want supplying with fresh poles; so the provident man
    brings his bundle into the grounds, and sticks them in laterally or
    a-top of the others, as the case requires, and all the old stocks go
    on growing again&mdash;but here, with us, whoever <i>wanted</i> Chaucer, or
    Chapman, or Ford, got him long ago&mdash;what else have Lamb, and
    Coleridge, and Hazlitt and Hunt and so on to the end of their
    generations ... what else been doing this many a year? What one
    passage of all these, cited with the very air of a Columbus, but has
    been known to all who know anything of poetry this many, many a year?
    The others, who don't know anything, are the stocks that have got to
    <i>shoot</i>, not climb higher&mdash;<i>compost</i>, they want in the first place!
    Ford's and Crashaw's rival Nightingales&mdash;why they have been
    dissertated on by Wordsworth and Coleridge, then by Lamb and Hazlitt,
    then worked to death by Hunt, who printed them entire and quoted them
    to pieces again, in every periodical he was ever engaged upon; and yet
    after all, here 'Philip'&mdash;'must read' (out of a roll of dropping
    papers with yellow ink tracings, so old!) something at which 'John'
    claps his hands and says 'Really&mdash;that these ancients should own so
    much wit &amp;c.'! The <i>passage</i> no longer looks its fresh self after this
    veritable passage from hand to hand: as when, in old dances, the belle
    began the figure with her own partner, and by him was transferred to
    the next, and so to the next&mdash;<i>they</i> ever <i>beginning</i> with all the old
    alacrity and spirit; but she bearing a still-accumulating weight of
    tokens of gallantry, and none the better for every fresh pushing and
    shoving and pulling and hauling&mdash;till, at the bottom of the room&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    To which Mr. Lowell might say, that&mdash;No, I will say the true thing
    against myself&mdash;and it is, that when I turn from what is in my mind,
    and determine to write about anybody's book to avoid writing that I
    love and love and love again my own, dearest love&mdash;because of the
    cuckoo-song of it,&mdash;<i>then</i>, I shall be in no better humour with that
    book than with Mr. Lowell's!
</p>
<p>
    But I <i>have</i> a new thing to say or sing&mdash;you never before heard me
    love and bless and send my heart after&mdash;'Ba'&mdash;did you? Ba ... and
    that is you! I <SPAN class="sc-ex">tried</span> ... (more than <i>wanted</i>) to call you <i>that</i>, on
    Wednesday! I have a flower here&mdash;rather, a tree, a mimosa, which must
    be turned and turned, the side to the light changing in a little time
    to the <i>leafy</i> side, where all the fans lean and spread ... so I turn
    your name to me, that side I have not last seen: you cannot tell how I
    feel glad that you will not part with the name&mdash;Barrett&mdash;seeing you
    have two of the same&mdash;and must always, moreover, remain my EBB!
</p>
<p>
    Dearest 'E.B.C.'&mdash;no, no! and so it will never be!
</p>
<p>
    Have you seen Mr. Kenyon? I did not write ... knowing that such a
    procedure would draw the kind sure letter in return, with the
    invitation &amp;c., as if I had asked for it! I had perhaps better call on
    him some morning very early.
</p>
<p>
    Bless you, my own sweetest. You will write to me, I know in my heart!

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, December 20, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, you know how to say what makes me happiest, you who never
    think, you say, of making me happy! For my part I do not think of it
    either; I simply understand that you <i>are</i> my happiness, and that
    therefore you could not make another happiness for me, such as would
    be worth having&mdash;not even <i>you</i>! Why, how could you? <i>That</i> was in my
    mind to speak yesterday, but I could not speak it&mdash;to write it, is
    easier.
</p>
<p>
    Talking of happiness&mdash;shall I tell you? Promise not to be angry and I
    will tell you. I have thought sometimes that, if I considered myself
    wholly, I should choose to die this winter&mdash;now&mdash;before I had
    disappointed you in anything. But because you are better and dearer
    and more to be considered than I, I do <i>not</i> choose it. I <i>cannot</i>
    choose to give you any pain, even on the chance of its being a less
    pain, a less evil, than what may follow perhaps (who can say?), if I
    should prove the burden of your life.
</p>
<p>
    For if you make me happy with some words, you frighten me with
    others&mdash;as with the extravagance yesterday&mdash;and seriously&mdash;<i>too</i>
    seriously, when the moment for smiling at them is past&mdash;I am
    frightened, I tremble! When you come to know me as well as I know
    myself, what can save me, do you think, from disappointing and
    displeasing you? I ask the question, and find no answer.
</p>
<p>
    It is a poor answer, to say that I can do one thing well ... that I
    have one capacity largely. On points of the general affections, I have
    in thought applied to myself the words of Mme. de Stael, not
    fretfully, I hope, not complainingly, I am sure (I can thank God for
    most affectionate friends!) not complainingly, yet mournfully and in
    profound conviction&mdash;those words&mdash;'<i>jamais je n'ai pas été aimée comme
    j'aime</i>.' The capacity of loving is the largest of my powers I
    think&mdash;I thought so before knowing you&mdash;and one form of feeling. And
    although any woman might love you&mdash;<i>every</i> woman,&mdash;with understanding
    enough to discern you by&mdash;(oh, do not fancy that I am unduly
    magnifying mine office) yet I persist in persuading myself that!
    Because I have the capacity, as I said&mdash;and besides I owe more to you
    than others could, it seems to me: let me boast of it. To many, you
    might be better than all things while one of all things: to me you are
    instead of all&mdash;to many, a crowning happiness&mdash;to me, the happiness
    itself. From out of the deep dark pits men see the stars more
    gloriously&mdash;and <i>de profundis amavi</i>&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    It is a very poor answer! Almost as poor an answer as yours could be
    if I were to ask you to teach me to please you always; or rather, how
    not to displease you, disappoint you, vex you&mdash;what if all those
    things were in my fate?
</p>
<p>
    And&mdash;(to begin!)&mdash;<i>I</i> am disappointed to-night. I expected a letter
    which does not come&mdash;and I had felt so sure of having a letter
    to-night ... unreasonably sure perhaps, which means doubly sure.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Remember you have had two notes of mine, and that it is
    certainly not my turn to write, though I am writing.
</p>
<p>
    Scarcely you had gone on Wednesday when Mr. Kenyon came. It seemed
    best to me, you know, that you should go&mdash;I had the presentiment of
    his footsteps&mdash;and so near they were, that if you had looked up the
    street in leaving the door, you must have seen him! Of course I told
    him of your having been here and also at his house; whereupon he
    enquired eagerly if you meant to dine with him, seeming disappointed
    by my negative. 'Now I had told him,' he said ... and murmured on to
    himself loud enough for me to hear, that 'it would have been a
    peculiar pleasure &amp;c.' The reason I have not seen him lately is the
    eternal 'business,' just as you thought, and he means to come 'oftener
    now,' so nothing is wrong as I half thought.
</p>
<p>
    As your letter does not come it is a good opportunity for asking what
    sort of ill humour, or (to be more correct) bad temper, you most
    particularly admire&mdash;sulkiness?&mdash;the divine gift of sitting aloof in a
    cloud like any god for three weeks together perhaps&mdash;pettishness? ...
    which will get you up a storm about a crooked pin or a straight one
    either? obstinacy?&mdash;which is an agreeable form of temper I can assure
    you, and describes itself&mdash;or the good open passion which lies on the
    floor and kicks, like one of my cousins?&mdash;Certainly I prefer the last,
    and should, I think, prefer it (as an evil), even if it were not the
    born weakness of my own nature&mdash;though I humbly confess (to <i>you</i>, who
    seem to think differently of these things) that never since I was a
    child have I upset all the chairs and tables and thrown the books
    about the room in a fury&mdash;I am afraid I do not even 'kick,' like my
    cousin, now. Those demonstrations were all done by the 'light of other
    days'&mdash;not a very full light, I used to be accustomed to think:&mdash;but
    <i>you</i>,&mdash;<i>you</i> think otherwise, <i>you</i> take a fury to be the opposite of
    'indifference,' as if there could be no such thing as self-control!
    Now for my part, I do believe that the worst-tempered persons in the
    world are less so through sensibility than selfishness&mdash;they spare
    nobody's heart, on the ground of being themselves pricked by a straw.
    Now see if it isn't so. What, after all, is a good temper but
    generosity in trifles&mdash;and what, without it, is the happiness of life?
    We have only to look round us. I <i>saw</i> a woman, once, burst into
    tears, because her husband cut the bread and butter too thick. I saw
    <i>that</i> with my own eyes. Was it <i>sensibility</i>, I wonder! They were at
    least real tears and ran down her cheeks. 'You <i>always</i> do it'! she
    said.
</p>
<p>
    Why how you must sympathize with the heroes and heroines of the French
    romances (<i>do</i> you sympathize with them very much?) when at the
    slightest provocation they break up the tables and chairs, (a degree
    beyond the deeds of my childhood!&mdash;<i>I</i> only used to upset them) break
    up the tables and chairs and chiffoniers, and dash the china to atoms.
    The men <i>do</i> the furniture, and the women the porcelain: and pray
    observe that they always set about this as a matter of course! When
    they have broken everything in the room, they sink down quite (and
    very naturally) <i>abattus</i>. I remember a particular case of a hero of
    Frederic Soulié's, who, in the course of an 'emotion,' takes up a
    chair <i>unconsciously</i>, and breaks it into very small pieces, and then
    proceeds with his soliloquy. Well!&mdash;the clearest idea this excites in
    <i>me</i>, is of the low condition in Paris, of moral government and of
    upholstery. Because&mdash;just consider for yourself&mdash;how <i>you</i> would
    succeed in breaking to pieces even a three-legged stool if it were
    properly put together&mdash;as stools are in England&mdash;just yourself,
    without a hammer and a screw! You might work at it <i>comme quatre</i>, and
    find it hard to finish, I imagine. And then as a demonstration, a
    child of six years old might demonstrate just so (in his sphere) and
    be whipped accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    How I go on writing!&mdash;and you, who do not write at all!&mdash;two extremes,
    one set against the other.
</p>
<p>
    But I must say, though in ever such an ill temper (which you know is
    just the time to select for writing a panegyric upon good temper) that
    I am glad you do not despise my own right name too much, because I
    never was called Elizabeth by any one who loved me at all, and I
    accept the omen. So little it seems my name that if a voice said
    suddenly 'Elizabeth,' I should as soon turn round as my sisters would
    ... no sooner. Only, my own right name has been complained of for want
    of euphony ... <i>Ba</i> ... now and then it has&mdash;and Mr. Boyd makes a
    compromise and calls me <i>Elibet</i>, because nothing could induce him to
    desecrate his organs accustomed to Attic harmonies, with a <i>Ba</i>. So I
    am glad, and accept the omen.
</p>
<p>
    But I give you no credit for not thinking that I may forget you ... I!
    As if you did not see the difference! Why, <i>I</i> could not even forget
    to <i>write</i> to <i>you</i>, observe!&mdash;
</p>

    Whenever you write, say how you are. Were you wet on Wednesday?

    I do not, nor will not think, dearest, of ever 'making you happy'&mdash;I
    can imagine no way of working that end, which does not go straight to
    my own truest, only true happiness&mdash;yet in every such effort there is
    implied some distinction, some supererogatory grace, or why speak of
    it at all? <i>You</i> it is, are my happiness, and all that ever can be:

    But never, if you would not, what you will not do I know, never revert
    to <i>that</i> frightful wish. 'Disappoint me?' 'I speak what I know and
    testify what I have seen'&mdash;you shall 'mystery' again and again&mdash;I do
    not dispute that, but do not <i>you</i> dispute, neither, that mysteries
    are. But it is simply because I do most justice to the mystical part
    of what I feel for you, because I consent to lay most stress on that
    fact of facts that I love you, beyond admiration, and respect, and
    esteem and affection even, and do not adduce any reason which stops
    short of accounting for <i>that</i>, whatever else it would account for,

    I have your letter now, and now I am sorry I sent mine. If I wrote
    that you had 'forgotten to write,' I did not mean it; not a word! If I
    had meant it I should not have written it. But it would have been
    better for every reason to have waited just a little longer before
    writing at all. A besetting sin of mine is an impatience which makes
    people laugh when it does not entangle their silks, pull their knots
    tighter, and tear their books in cutting them open.

    How right you are about Mr. Lowell! He has a refined fancy and is
    graceful for an American critic, but the truth is, otherwise, that he
    knows nothing of English poetry or the next thing to nothing, and has
    merely had a dream of the early dramatists. The amount of his reading
    in that direction is an article in the <i>Retrospective Review</i> which
    contains extracts; and he re-extracts the extracts, re-quotes the
    quotations, and, 'a pede Herculem,' from the foot infers the man, or
    rather from the sandal-string of the foot, infers and judges the soul
    of the man&mdash;it is comparative anatomy under the most speculative
    conditions. How a writer of his talents and pretensions could make up
    his mind to make up a book on such slight substratum, is a curious
    proof of the state of literature in America. Do you not think so? Why
    a lecturer on the English Dramatists for a 'Young Ladies' academy'
    here in England, might take it to be necessary to have better
    information than he could gather from an odd volume of an old review!
    And then, Mr. Lowell's naïveté in showing his authority,&mdash;as if the
    Elizabethan poets lay mouldering in inaccessible manuscript somewhere
    below the lowest deep of Shakespeare's grave,&mdash;is curious beyond the
    rest! Altogether, the fact is an epigram on the surface-literature of
    America. As you say, their books do not suit us:&mdash;Mrs. Markham might
    as well send her compendium of the History of France to M. Thiers. If
    they <i>knew</i> more they could not give parsley crowns to their own
    native poets when there is greater merit among the rabbits. Mrs.
    Sigourney has just sent me&mdash;just this morning&mdash;her 'Scenes in my
    Native Land' and, peeping between the uncut leaves, I read of the poet
    Hillhouse, of 'sublime spirit and Miltonic energy,' standing in 'the
    temple of Fame' as if it were built on purpose for him. I suppose he
    is like most of the American poets, who are shadows of the true, as
    flat as a shadow, as colourless as a shadow, as lifeless and as
    transitory. Mr. Lowell himself is, in his verse-books, poetical, if
    not a poet&mdash;and certainly this little book we are talking of is
    grateful enough in some ways&mdash;you would call it a <i>pretty book</i>&mdash;would
    you not? Two or three letters I have had from him ... all very
    kind!&mdash;and <i>that</i> reminds me, alas! of some ineffable ingratitude on
    my own part! When one's conscience grows too heavy, there is nothing
    for it but to throw it away!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Do you remember how I tried to tell you what he said of you, and how
    you would not let me?

    Barrett:&mdash;surname, Moulton Barrett. So long it is, that to make it
    portable, I fell into the habit of doubling it up and packing it
    closely, ... and of forgetting that I was a <i>Moulton</i>, altogether. One
    might as well write the alphabet as all four initials. Yet our
    family-name is <i>Moulton Barrett</i>, and my brothers reproach me
    sometimes for sacrificing the governorship of an old town in Norfolk
    with a little honourable verdigris from the Heralds' Office. As if I
    cared for the <i>Retrospective Review</i>! Nevertheless it is true that I
    would give ten towns in Norfolk (if I had them) to own some purer
    lineage than that of the blood of the slave! Cursed we are from
    generation to generation!&mdash;I seem to hear the 'Commination Service.'

<p>
    You do not say how you are&mdash;not a word! And you are wrong in saying

</p>
<p>
    Now, '<i>ought</i>' you to be 'sorry you sent that letter,' which made, and
    makes me so happy&mdash;so happy&mdash;can you bring yourself to turn round and
    tell one you have so blessed with your bounty that there was a
    mistake, and you meant only half that largess? If you are not sensible
    that you <i>do</i> make me most happy by such letters, and do not warm in
    the reflection of your own rays, then I <i>do</i> give up indeed the last
    chance of procuring <i>you</i> happiness. My own 'ought,' which you object
    to, shall be withdrawn&mdash;being only a pure bit of selfishness; I felt,
    in missing the letter of yours, next day, that I <i>might</i> have drawn it
    down by one of mine,&mdash;if I had begged never so gently, the gold would
    have fallen&mdash;<i>there</i> was my omitted duty to myself which you properly
    blame. I should stand silently and wait and be sure of the
    ever-remembering goodness.
</p>
<p>
    Let me count my gold now&mdash;and rub off any speck that stays the full
    shining. First&mdash;<i>that thought</i> ... I told you; I pray you, pray you,
    sweet&mdash;never that again&mdash;or what leads never so remotely or indirectly
    to it! On <i>your own fancied ground</i>, the fulfilment would be of
    necessity fraught with every woe that can fall in this life. I am
    yours for ever&mdash;if you are not <i>here</i>, with me&mdash;what then? Say, you
    take all of yourself away but just enough to live on; then, <i>that</i>
    defeats every kind purpose ... as if you cut away all the ground from
    my feet but so much as serves for bare standing room ... why still, I
    <i>stand</i> there&mdash;and is it the better that I have no broader space,
    when off <i>that</i> you cannot force me? I have your memory, the knowledge
    of you, the idea of you printed into my heart and brain,&mdash;on that, I
    can live my life&mdash;but it is for you, the dear, utterly generous
    creature I know you, to give me more and more beyond mere life&mdash;to
    extend life and deepen it&mdash;as you do, and will do. Oh, <i>how</i> I love
    you when I think of the entire truthfulness of your generosity to
    me&mdash;how, meaning and willing to <i>give</i>, you gave <i>nobly</i>! Do you think
    I have not seen in this world how women who <i>do</i> love will manage to
    confer that gift on occasion? And shall I allow myself to fancy how
    much alloy such pure gold as <i>your</i> love would have rendered
    endurable? Yet it came, virgin ore, to complete my fortune! And what
    but this makes me confident and happy? <i>Can</i> I take a lesson by your
    fancies, and begin frightening myself with saying ... 'But if she saw
    all the world&mdash;the worthier, better men there ... those who would' &amp;c.
    &amp;c. No, I think of the great, dear <i>gift</i> that it was; how I '<i>won</i>'
    <SPAN class="sc-ex">nothing</span> (the hateful word, and <i>French</i> thought)&mdash;did nothing by my
    own arts or cleverness in the matter ... so what pretence have the
    <i>more</i> artful or more clever for:&mdash;but I cannot write out this
    folly&mdash;I am yours for ever, with the utmost sense of gratitude&mdash;to say
    I would give you my life joyfully is little.... I would, I hope, do
    that for two or three other people&mdash;but I am not conscious of any
    imaginable point in which I would not implicitly devote my whole self
    to you&mdash;be disposed of by you as for the best. There! It is not to be
    spoken of&mdash;let me <i>live</i> it into proof, beloved!
</p>
<p>
    And for 'disappointment and a burden' ... now&mdash;let us get quite away
    from ourselves, and not see one of the filaments, but only the <i>cords</i>
    of love with the world's horny eye. Have we such jarring tastes, then?
    Does your inordinate attachment to gay life interfere with my deep
    passion for society? 'Have they common sympathy in each other's
    pursuits?'&mdash;always asks Mrs. Tomkins! Well, here was I when you knew
    me, fixed in my way of life, meaning with God's help to write what
    may be written and so die at peace with myself so far. Can you help me
    or no? Do you <i>not</i> help me so much that, if you saw the more likely
    peril for poor human nature, you would say, 'He will be jealous of all
    the help coming from me,&mdash;none from him to me!'&mdash;And <i>that would</i> be a
    consequence of the help, all-too-great for hope of return, with any
    one less possessed than I with the exquisiteness of being
    <i>transcended</i> and the <i>blest</i> one.
</p>
<p>
    But&mdash;'here comes the Selah and the voice is hushed'&mdash;I will speak of
    other things. When we are together one day&mdash;the days I believe in&mdash;I
    mean to set about that reconsidering 'Sordello'&mdash;it has always been
    rather on my mind&mdash;but yesterday I was reading the 'Purgatorio' and
    the first speech of the group of which Sordello makes one struck me
    with a new significance, as well describing the man and his purpose
    and fate in my own poem&mdash;see; one of the burthened, contorted souls
    tells Virgil and Dante&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Noi fummo già tutti per forza morti,<br>
E <i>peccatori infin' all' ultim' ora</i>:<br>
<SPAN class="sc-ex">Quivi</span>&mdash;<i>lume del ciel ne fece accorti<br>

Di vita uscimmo a Dio pacificati<br>
Che del disio di se veder n'accora.</i><a href="#note-23"><b>23</b></a>

</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Which is just my Sordello's story ... could I '<i>do</i>' it off hand, I
    wonder&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">And sinners were we to the extreme hour;<br>
    <i>Then</i>, light from heaven fell, making us aware,<br>
So that, repenting us and pardoned, out<br>
Of life we passed to God, at peace with Him<br>
Who fills the heart with yearning Him to see.

    There were many singular incidents attending my work on that
    subject&mdash;thus, quite at the end, I found out there <i>was printed</i> and
    not published, a little historical tract by a Count V&mdash;&mdash; something,
    called 'Sordello'&mdash;with the motto 'Post fata resurgam'! I hope he
    prophesied. The main of this&mdash;biographical notices&mdash;is extracted by
    Muratori, I think. Last year when I set foot in Naples I found after a
    few minutes that at some theatre, that night, the opera was to be 'one
    act of Sordello' and I never looked twice, nor expended a couple of
    carlines on the <i>libretto</i>!
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to tell you, in last letter, that when I spoke of people's
    tempers <i>you</i> have no concern with 'people'&mdash;I do not glance obliquely
    at <i>your</i> temper&mdash;either to discover it, or praise it, or adapt myself
    to it. I speak of the relation one sees in other cases&mdash;how one
    opposes passionate foolish people, but hates cold clever people who
    take quite care enough of themselves. I myself am born supremely
    passionate&mdash;so I was born with light yellow hair: all changes&mdash;that is
    the passion changes its direction and, taking a channel large enough,
    looks calmer, perhaps, than it should&mdash;and all my sympathies go with
    quiet strength, of course&mdash;but I know what the other kind is. As for
    the breakages of chairs, and the appreciation of Parisian <i>meubles</i>;
    manibus, pedibusque descendo in tuam sententiam, Ba, mi ocelle! ('What
    was E.B. C?' why, the first letter after, and <i>not</i>, E.B. <i>B</i>, my own
    <i>B</i>! There was no latent meaning in the C&mdash;but I had no inclination to
    go on to D, or E, for instance).
</p>
<p>
    And so, love, Tuesday is to be our day&mdash;one day more&mdash;and then! And
    meanwhile '<i>care</i>' for me! a good word for you&mdash;but <i>my</i> care, what is
    that! One day I aspire to <i>care</i>, though! I shall not go away at any
    dear Mr. K.'s coming! They call me down-stairs to supper&mdash;and my fire
    is out, and you keep me from feeling cold and yet ask if I am well?
    Yes, well&mdash;yes, happy&mdash;and your own ever&mdash;I must bid God bless
    you&mdash;dearest!

</p>
<p>
    But did I dispute? Surely not. Surely I believe in you and in
    'mysteries.' Surely I prefer the no-reason to ever so much rationalism
    ... (rationalism and infidelity go together they say!). All which I
    may do, and be afraid sometimes notwithstanding, and when you
    overpraise me (<i>not</i> over<i>love</i>) I must be frightened as I told you.
</p>
<p>
    It is with me as with the theologians. I believe in you and can be
    happy and safe <i>so</i>; but when my 'personal merits' come into question
    in any way, even the least, ... why then the position grows untenable:
    it is no more 'of grace.'
</p>
<p>
    Do I tease you as I tease myself sometimes? But do not wrong me in
    turn! Do not keep repeating that 'after long years' I shall know
    you&mdash;know you!&mdash;as if I did not without the years. If you are forced
    to refer me to those long ears, I must deserve the thistles besides.
    The thistles are the corollary.
</p>
<p>
    For it is obvious&mdash;manifest&mdash;that I cannot doubt of you, that I may
    doubt of myself, of happiness, of the whole world,&mdash;but of
    <i>you</i>&mdash;<i>not</i>: it is obvious that if I could doubt of you and <i>act so</i>
    I should be a very idiot, or worse indeed. And <i>you</i> ... you think I
    doubt of you whenever I make an interjection!&mdash;now do you not? And is
    it reasonable?&mdash;Of <i>you</i>, I mean?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;For my part, you must admit it to be too possible that you
    may be, as I say, 'disappointed' in me&mdash;it <i>is</i> too possible. And if
    it does me good to say so, even now perhaps ... if it is mere weakness
    to say so and simply torments you, why do <i>you</i> be magnanimous and
    forgive <i>that</i> ... let it pass as a weakness and forgive it <i>so</i>.
    Often I think painful things which I do not tell you and....
</p>
<p>
    While I write, your letter comes. Kindest of you it was, to write me
    such a letter, when I expected scarcely the shadow of one!&mdash;this makes
    up for the other letter which I expected unreasonably and which you
    '<i>ought not</i>' to have written, as was proved afterwards. And now why
    should I go on with that sentence? What had I to say of 'painful
    things,' I wonder? all the painful things seem gone ... vanished. I
    forget what I had to say. Only do you still think of this, dearest
    beloved; that I sit here in the dark but for <i>you</i>, and that the light
    you bring me (from <i>my</i> fault!&mdash;from the nature of <i>my</i> darkness!) is
    not a settled light as when you open the shutters in the morning, but
    a light made by candles which burn some of them longer and some
    shorter, and some brighter and briefer, at once&mdash;being 'double-wicks,'
    and that there is an intermission for a moment now and then between
    the dropping of the old light into the socket and the lighting of the
    new. Every letter of yours is a new light which burns so many hours
    ... and <i>then</i>!&mdash;I am morbid, you see&mdash;or call it by what name you
    like ... too wise or too foolish. 'If the light of the body is
    darkness, how great is that darkness.' Yet even when I grow too wise,
    I admit always that while you love me it is an answer to all. And I am
    never so much too foolish as to wish to be worthier for my own
    sake&mdash;only for yours:&mdash;not for my own sake, since I am content to owe
    all things to you.
</p>
<p>
    And it could be so much to you to lose me!&mdash;and you say so,&mdash;and
    <i>then</i> think it needful to tell me not to think the other thought! As
    if <i>that</i> were possible! Do you remember what you said once of the
    flowers?&mdash;that you 'felt a respect for them when they had passed out
    of your hands.' And must it not be so with my life, which if you
    choose to have it, must be respected too? Much more with my life!
    Also, see that I, who had my warmest affections on the other side of
    the grave, feel that it is otherwise with me now&mdash;quite otherwise. I
    did not like it at first to be so much otherwise. And I could not have
    had any such thought through a weariness of life or any of my old
    motives, but simply to escape the 'risk' I told you of. Should I have
    said to you instead of it ... '<i>Love me for ever</i>'? Well then, ... I
    <i>do</i>.
</p>
<p>
    As to my 'helping' you, my help is in your fancy; and if you go on
    with the fancy, I perfectly understand that it will be as good as
    deeds. We <i>have</i> sympathy too&mdash;we walk one way&mdash;oh, I do not forget
    the advantages. Only Mrs. Tomkins's ideas of happiness are below my
    ambition for you.
</p>
<p>
    So often as I have said (it reminds me) that in this situation I
    should be more exacting than any other woman&mdash;so often I have said it:
    and so different everything is from what I thought it would be!
    Because if I am exacting it is for <i>you</i> and not for <i>me</i>&mdash;it is
    altogether for <i>you</i>&mdash;you understand <i>that</i>, dearest of all ... it is
    for <i>you wholly</i>. It never crosses my thought, in a lightning even,
    the question whether I may be happy so and so&mdash;<i>I</i>. It is the other
    question which comes always&mdash;too often for peace.
</p>
<p>
    People used to say to me, 'You expect too much&mdash;you are too romantic.'
    And my answer always was that 'I could not expect too much when I
    expected nothing at all' ... which was the truth&mdash;for I never thought
    (and how often I have <i>said that</i>!) I never thought that anyone whom
    <i>I</i> could love, would stoop to love <i>me</i> ... the two things seemed
    clearly incompatible to my understanding.
</p>
<p>
    And now when it comes in a miracle, you wonder at me for looking
    twice, thrice, four times, to see if it comes through ivory or <i>horn</i>.
    You wonder that it should seem to me at first all illusion&mdash;illusion
    for you,&mdash;illusion for me as a consequence. But how natural.
</p>
<p>
    It is true of me&mdash;very true&mdash;that I have not a high appreciation of
    what passes in the world (and not merely the Tomkins-world!) under the
    name of love; and that a distrust of the thing had grown to be a habit
    of mind with me when I knew you first. It has appeared to me, through
    all the seclusion of my life and the narrow experience it admitted
    of, that in nothing men&mdash;and women too&mdash;were so apt to mistake their
    own feelings, as in this one thing. Putting <i>falseness</i> quite on one
    side, quite out of sight and consideration, an honest mistaking of
    feeling appears wonderfully common, and no mistake has such frightful
    results&mdash;none can. Self-love and generosity, a mistake may come from
    either&mdash;from pity, from admiration, from any blind impulse&mdash;oh, when I
    look at the histories of my own female friends&mdash;to go no step further!
    And if it is true of the <i>women</i>, what must the other side be? To see
    the marriages which are made every day! worse than solitudes and more
    desolate! In the case of the two happiest I ever knew, one of the
    husbands said in confidence to a brother of mine&mdash;not much in
    confidence or I should not have heard it, but in a sort of smoking
    frankness,&mdash;that he had 'ruined his prospects by marrying'; and the
    other said to himself at the very moment of professing an
    extraordinary happiness, ... 'But I should have done as well if I had
    not married <i>her</i>.'
</p>
<p>
    Then for the falseness&mdash;the first time I ever, in my own experience,
    heard that word which rhymes to glove and comes as easily off and on
    (on some hands!)&mdash;it was from a man of whose attentions to another
    woman I was at that <i>time her confidante</i>. I was bound so to silence
    for her sake, that I could not even speak the scorn that was in
    me&mdash;and in fact my uppermost feeling was a sort of horror ... a
    terror&mdash;for I was very young then, and the world did, at the moment,
    look ghastly!
</p>
<p>
    The falseness and the calculations!&mdash;why how can you, who are <i>just</i>,
    <i>blame women</i> ... when you must know what the 'system' of man is
    towards them,&mdash;and of men not ungenerous otherwise? Why are women to
    be blamed if they act as if they had to do with swindlers?&mdash;is it not
    the mere instinct of preservation which makes them do it? These make
    women what they are. And your 'honourable men,' the most loyal of
    them, (for instance) is it not a rule with them (unless when taken
    unaware through a want of self-government) to force a woman (trying
    all means) to force a woman to stand committed in her affections ...
    (they with their feet lifted all the time to trample on her for want
    of delicacy) before <i>they</i> risk the pin-prick to their own personal
    pitiful vanities? Oh&mdash;to see how these things are set about by <i>men</i>!
    to see how a man carefully holding up on each side the skirts of an
    embroidered vanity to keep it quite safe from the wet, will contrive
    to tell you in so many words that he ... might love you if the sun
    shone! And women are to be blamed! Why there are, to be sure, cold and
    heartless, light and changeable, ungenerous and calculating women in
    the world!&mdash;that is sure. But for the most part, they are only what
    they are made ... and far better than the nature of the making ... of
    that I am confident. The loyal make the loyal, the disloyal the
    disloyal. And I give no more discredit to those women you speak of,
    than I myself can take any credit in this thing&mdash;I. Because who could
    be disloyal with <i>you</i> ... with whatever corrupt inclination? <i>you</i>,
    who are the noblest of all? If you judge me so, ... it is my privilege
    rather than my merit ... as I feel of myself.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;All but the last few lines of all this was written
    before I saw you yesterday, ever dearest&mdash;and since, I have been
    reading your third act which is perfectly noble and worthy of you both
    in the conception and expression, and carries the reader on
    triumphantly ... to speak for one reader. It seems to me too that the
    language is freer&mdash;there is less inversion and more breadth of rhythm.
    It just strikes me so for the first impression. At any rate the
    interest grows and grows. You have a secret about Domizia, I
    guess&mdash;which will not be told till the last perhaps. And that poor,
    noble Luria, who will be equal to the leap ... as it is easy to see.
    It is full, altogether, of magnanimities;&mdash;noble, and nobly put. I
    will go on with my notes, and those, you shall have at once ... I mean
    together ... presently. And don't hurry and chafe yourself for the
    fourth act&mdash;now that you are better! To be ill again&mdash;think what that
    would be! Luria will be great now whatever you do&mdash;or whatever you do
    <i>not</i>. Will he not?
</p>
<p>
    And never, never for a moment (I quite forgot to tell you) did I fancy
    that you were talking at <i>me</i> in the temper-observations&mdash;never. It
    was the most unprovoked egotism, all that I told you of my temper; for
    certainly I never suspected you of asking questions so. I was simply
    amused a little by what you said, and thought to myself (if you <i>will</i>
    know my thoughts on that serious subject) that you had probably lived
    among very good-tempered persons, to hold such an opinion about the
    innocuousness of ill-temper. It was all I thought, indeed. Now to
    fancy that I was capable of suspecting you of such a manoeuvre! Why
    you would have <i>asked</i> me directly;&mdash;if you had wished 'curiously to
    enquire.'
</p>
<p>
    An excellent solemn chiming, the passage from Dante makes with your
    'Sordello,' and the 'Sordello' <i>deserves</i> the labour which it needs,
    to make it appear the great work it is. I think that the principle of
    association is too subtly in movement throughout it&mdash;so that <i>while</i>
    you are going straight forward you go at the same time round and
    round, until the progress involved in the motion is lost sight of by
    the lookers on. Or did I tell you that before?
</p>
<p>
    You have heard, I suppose, how Dickens's 'Cricket' sells by nineteen
    thousand copies at a time, though he takes Michael Angelo to be 'a
    humbug'&mdash;or for 'though' read 'because.' Tell me of Mr. Kenyon's
    dinner and Moxon?
</p>
<p>
    Is not this an infinite letter? I shall hear from you, I hope.... I
    <i>ask</i> you to let me hear soon. I write all sorts of things to you,
    rightly and wrongly perhaps; when wrongly forgive it. I think of you
    always. May God bless you. 'Love me for ever,' as

    My dear Christmas gift of a letter! I will write back a few lines,
    (all I can, having to go out now)&mdash;just that I may forever,&mdash;certainly
    during our mortal 'forever'&mdash;mix my love for you, and, as you suffer
    me to say, your love for me ... dearest! ... these shall be mixed with
    the other loves of the day and live therein&mdash;as I write, and trust,
    and know&mdash;forever! While I live I will remember what was my feeling in
    reading, and in writing, and in stopping from either ... as I have
    just done ... to kiss you and bless you with my whole heart.&mdash;Yes,
    yes, bless you, my own!
</p>
<p>
    All is right, all of your letter ... admirably right and just in the
    defence of the women I <i>seemed</i> to speak against; and only
    seemed&mdash;because that is a way of mine which you must have observed;
    that foolish concentrating of thought and feeling, for a moment, on
    some one little spot of a character or anything else indeed, and in
    the attempt to do justice and develop whatever may seem ordinarily to
    be overlooked in it,&mdash;that over vehement <i>insisting</i> on, and giving an
    undue prominence to, the same&mdash;which has the effect of taking away
    from the importance of the rest of the related objects which, in
    truth, are not considered at all ... or they would also rise
    proportionally when subjected to the same (that is, correspondingly
    magnified and dilated) light and concentrated feeling. So, you
    remember, the old divine, preaching on 'small sins,' in his zeal to
    expose the tendencies and consequences usually made little account of,
    was led to maintain the said small sins to be 'greater than great
    ones.' <i>But then</i> ... if you look on the world <i>altogether</i>, and
    accept the small natures, in their usual proportion with the greater
    ... things do not look <i>quite</i> so bad; because the conduct which <i>is</i>
    atrocious in those higher cases, of proposal and acceptance, <i>may</i> be
    no more than the claims of the occasion justify (wait and hear) in
    certain other cases where the thing sought for and granted is avowedly
    less by a million degrees. It shall all be traffic, exchange (counting
    spiritual gifts as only coin, for our purpose), but surely the
    formalities and policies and decencies all vary with the nature of the
    thing trafficked for. If a man makes up his mind during half his life
    to acquire a Pitt-diamond or a Pilgrim-pearl&mdash;[he] gets witnesses and
    testimony and so forth&mdash;but, surely, when I pass a shop where oranges
    are ticketed up seven for sixpence I offend no law by sparing all
    words and putting down the piece with a certain authoritative ring on
    the counter. If instead of diamonds you want&mdash;(being a king or
    queen)&mdash;provinces with live men on them ... there is so much more
    diplomacy required; new interests are appealed to&mdash;high motives
    <i>supposed</i>, at all events&mdash;whereas, when, in Naples, a man asks leave
    to black your shoe in the dusty street 'purely for the honour of
    serving your Excellency' you laugh and would be sorry to find yourself
    without a 'grano' or two&mdash;(six of which, about, make a farthing)&mdash;Now
    do you not see! Where so little is to be got, why offer much more? If
    a man knows that ... but I am teaching you! All I mean is, that, in
    Benedick's phrase, 'the world must go on.' He who honestly wants his
    wife to sit at the head of his table and carve ... that is be his
    <i>help-meat</i> (not 'help mete for him')&mdash;he shall assuredly find a girl
    of his degree who wants the table to sit at; and some dear friend to
    mortify, who <i>would</i> be glad of such a piece of fortune; and if that
    man offers that woman a bunch of orange-flowers and a sonnet, instead
    of a buck-horn-handled sabre-shaped knife, sheathed in a 'Every Lady
    Her Own <i>Market-Woman</i>, Being a Table of' &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;<i>then</i>, I say he

    I was forced to leave off abruptly on Christmas Morning&mdash;and now I

    return from Town earlier. But I can say something&mdash;and Monday will

    Yes; I did go to Mr. Kenyon's&mdash;who had a little to forgive in my slack
    justice to his good dinner, but was for the rest his own kind

</p>
<p>
    Yes, indeed, I have 'observed that way' in you, and not once, and not
    twice, and not twenty times, but oftener than any,&mdash;and almost every
    time ... do you know, ... with an uncomfortable feeling from the
    reflection that <i>that</i> is the way for making all sorts of mistakes
    dependent on and issuing in exaggeration. It is the very way!&mdash;the
    highway.
</p>
<p>
    For what you say in the letter here otherwise, I do not deny the
    truth&mdash;as partial truth:&mdash;I was speaking generally quite. Admit that I
    am not apt to be extravagant in my <i>esprit de sexe</i>: the Martineau
    doctrines of intellectual equality &amp;c., I gave them up, you remember,
    like a woman&mdash;most disgracefully, as Mrs. Jameson would tell me. But
    we are not on that ground now&mdash;we are on ground worth holding a brief
    for!&mdash;and when women fail <i>here</i> ... it is not so much our fault.
    Which was all I meant to say from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    It reminds me of the exquisite analysis in your 'Luria,' this third
    act, of the worth of a woman's sympathy,&mdash;indeed of the exquisite
    double-analysis of unlearned and learned sympathies. Nothing could be
    better, I think, than this:&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">To the motive, the endeavour,&mdash;the heart's self&mdash;<br>
Your quick sense looks; you crown and call aright<br>
The soul of the purpose ere 'tis shaped as act,<br>
Takes flesh i' the world, and clothes itself a king;
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">except the characterizing of the 'learned praise,' which comes
    afterwards in its fine subtle truth. What would these critics do to
    you, to what degree undo you, who would deprive you of the exercise of
    the discriminative faculty of the metaphysicians? As if a poet could
    be great without it! They might as well recommend a watchmaker to deal
    only in faces, in dials, and not to meddle with the wheels inside!
    You shall tell Mr. Forster so.
</p>
<p>
    And speaking of 'Luria,' which grows on me the more I read, ... how
    fine he is when the doubt breaks on him&mdash;I mean, when he begins ...
    'Why then, all is very well.' It is most affecting, I think, all that
    process of doubt ... and that reference to the friends at home (which
    at once proves him a stranger, and intimates, by just a stroke, that
    he will not look home for comfort out of the new foreign treason) is
    managed by you with singular dramatic dexterity....
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... 'so slight, so slight,<br>
And yet it tells you they are dead and gone'&mdash;
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">And then, the direct approach....
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">You now, so kind here, all you Florentines,<br>
What is it in your eyes?&mdash;
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>
    Do you not feel it to be success, ... '<i>you</i> now?' <i>I</i> do, from my low
    ground as reader. The whole breaking round him of the cloud, and the
    manner in which he <i>stands</i>, facing it, ... I admire it all
    thoroughly. Braccio's vindication of Florence strikes me as almost too
    <i>poetically</i> subtle for the man&mdash;but nobody could have the heart to
    wish a line of it away&mdash;<i>that</i> would be too much for critical virtue!
</p>
<p>
    I had your letter yesterday morning early. The post-office people were
    so resolved on keeping their Christmas, that they would not let me
    keep mine. No post all day, after that general post before noon, which
    never brings me anything worth the breaking of a seal!
</p>
<p>
    Am I to see you on Monday? If there should be the least, least
    crossing of that day, ... anything to do, anything to see, anything to
    listen to,&mdash;remember how Tuesday stands close by, and that another
    Monday comes on the following week. Now I need not say <i>that</i> every
    time, and you will please to remember it&mdash;Eccellenza!&mdash;

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.<br>
[Post-mark, December 30, 1845.]
</p>
<p>
    When you are gone I find your flowers; and you never spoke of nor
    showed them to me&mdash;so instead of yesterday I thank you to-day&mdash;thank
    you. Count among the miracles that your flowers live with me&mdash;I accept
    <i>that</i> for an omen, dear&mdash;dearest! Flowers in general, all other
    flowers, die of despair when they come into the same atmosphere ...
    used to do it so constantly and observably that it made me melancholy
    and I left off for the most part having them here. Now you see how
    they put up with the close room, and condescend to me and the dust&mdash;it
    is true and no fancy! To be sure they know that I care for them and
    that I stand up by the table myself to change their water and cut
    their stalk freshly at intervals&mdash;<i>that</i> may make a difference
    perhaps. Only the great reason must be that they are yours, and that
    you teach them to bear with me patiently.
</p>
<p>
    Do not pretend even to misunderstand what I meant to say yesterday of
    dear Mr. Kenyon. His blame would fall as my blame of myself has
    fallen: he would say&mdash;will say&mdash;'it is ungenerous of her to let such a
    risk be run! I thought she would have been more generous.' There, is
    Mr. Kenyon's opinion as I foresee it! Not that it would be spoken, you
    know! he is too kind. And then, he said to me last summer, somewhere
    <i>à propos</i> to the flies or butterflies, that he had 'long ceased to
    wonder at any extreme of foolishness produced by&mdash;<i>love</i>.' He will of
    course think you very very foolish, but not ungenerously foolish like
    other people.
</p>
<p>
    Never mind. I do not mind indeed. I mean, that, having said to myself
    worse than the worst perhaps of what can be said against me by any who
    regard me at all, and feeling it put to silence by the fact that you
    <i>do</i> feel so and so for me; feeling that fact to be an answer to
    all,&mdash;I cannot mind much, in comparison, the railing at second remove.
    There will be a nine days' railing of it and no more: and if on the
    ninth day you should not exactly wish never to have known me, the
    better reason will be demonstrated to stand with us. On this one point
    the wise man cannot judge for the fool his neighbour. If you <i>do</i> love
    me, the inference is that you would be happier with than without
    me&mdash;and whether you do, you know better than another: so I think of
    <i>you</i> and not of <i>them</i>&mdash;always of <i>you</i>! When I talked of being
    afraid of dear Mr. Kenyon, I just meant that he makes me nervous with
    his all-scrutinizing spectacles, put on for great occasions, and his
    questions which seem to belong to the spectacles, they go together
    so:&mdash;and then I have no presence of mind, as you may see without the
    spectacles. My only way of hiding (when people set themselves to look
    for me) would be the old child's way of getting behind the window
    curtains or under the sofa:&mdash;and even <i>that</i> might not be effectual if
    I had recourse to it now. Do you think it would? Two or three times I
    fancied that Mr. Kenyon suspected something&mdash;but if he ever <i>did</i>, his
    only reproof was a reduplicated praise of <i>you</i>&mdash;he praises you always
    and in relation to every sort of subject.
</p>
<p>
    What a <i>misomonsism</i> you fell into yesterday, you who have much great
    work to do which no one else can do except just yourself!&mdash;and you,
    too, who have courage and knowledge, and must know that every work,
    with the principle of life in it, <i>will</i> live, let it be trampled ever
    so under the heel of a faithless and unbelieving generation&mdash;yes, that
    it will live like one of your toads, for a thousand years in the heart
    of a rock. All men can teach at second or third hand, as you said ...
    by prompting the foremost rows ... by tradition and translation:&mdash;all,
    <i>except</i> poets, who must preach their own doctrine and sing their own
    song, to be the means of any wisdom or any music, and therefore have
    stricter duties thrust upon them, and may not lounge in the <span title="stoa">&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&alpha;</span>
    like the conversation-teachers. So much I have to say to you,
    till we are in the Siren's island&mdash;and <i>I</i>, jealous of the Siren!&mdash;
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The Siren waits thee singing song for song,
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">says Mr. Landor. A prophecy which refuses to class you with the 'mute
    fishes,' precisely as I do.
</p>
<p>
    And are you not my 'good'&mdash;all my good now&mdash;my only good ever? The
    Italians would say it better without saying more.
</p>
<p>
    I had a letter from Miss Martineau this morning who accounts for her
    long silence by the supposition,&mdash;put lately to an end by scarcely
    credible information from Mr. Moxon, she says&mdash;that I was out of
    England; gone to the South from the 20th of September. She calls
    herself the strongest of women, and talks of 'walking fifteen miles
    one day and writing fifteen pages another day without fatigue,'&mdash;also
    of mesmerizing and of being infinitely happy except in the continued
    alienation of two of her family who cannot forgive her for getting
    well by such unlawful means. And she is to write again to tell me of
    Wordsworth, and promises to send me her new work in the meanwhile&mdash;all
    very kind.
</p>
<p>
    So here is my letter to you, which you asked for so 'against the
    principles of universal justice.' Yes, very unjust&mdash;very unfair it
    was&mdash;only, you make me do just as you like in everything. Now confess
    to your own conscience that even if I had not a lawful claim of a debt
    against you, I might come to ask charity with another sort of claim,
    oh 'son of humanity.' Think how much more need of a letter <i>I</i> have
    than you can have; and that if you have a giant's power, ''tis
    tyrannous to use it like a giant.' Who would take tribute from the
    desert? How I grumble. <i>Do</i> let me have a letter directly! remember
    that no other light comes to my windows, and that I wait 'as those who
    watch for the morning'&mdash;'lux mea!'
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you&mdash;and mind to say how you are <i>exactly</i>, and don't
    neglect the walking, <i>pray</i> do not.
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your own
</p>
<p>
    And after all, those women! A great deal of doctrine commends and
    discommends itself by the delivery: and an honest thing may be said so
    foolishly as to disprove its very honesty. Now after all, what did she
    mean by that very silly expression about books, but that she did not
    feel as she considered herself capable of feeling&mdash;and that else but
    <i>that</i> was the meaning of the other woman? Perhaps it should have been
    spoken earlier&mdash;nay, clearly it should&mdash;but surely it was better
    spoken even in the last hour than not at all ... surely it is always
    and under all circumstances, better spoken at whatever cost&mdash;I have
    thought so steadily since I could think or feel at all. An entire
    openness to the last moment of possible liberty, at whatever cost and
    consequence, is the most honourable and most merciful way, both for
    men and women! perhaps for men in an especial manner. But I shall send
    this letter away, being in haste to get change for it.
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday, December 31, 1845.
</p>
<p>
    I have been properly punished for so much treachery as went to that
    re-urging the prayer that <i>you</i> would begin writing, when all the time
    (after the first of those words had been spoken which bade <i>me</i> write)
    I was full of purpose to send my own note last evening; one which
    should do its best to thank you: but see, the punishment! At home I
    found a note from Mr. Horne&mdash;on the point of setting out for Ireland,
    too unwell to manage to come over to me; anxious, so he said, to see
    me before leaving London, and with only Tuesday or to-day to allow the
    opportunity of it, if I should choose to go and find him out. So I
    considered all things and determined to go&mdash;but not till so late did I
    determine on Tuesday, that there was barely time to get to
    Highgate&mdash;wherefore no letter reached you to beg pardon ... and now
    this undeserved&mdash;beyond the usual undeservedness&mdash;this
    last-day-of-the-Year's gift&mdash;do you think or not think my gratitude
    weighs on me? When I lay this with the others, and remember what you
    have done for me&mdash;I do bless you&mdash;so as I cannot but believe must
    reach the all-beloved head all my hopes and fancies and cares fly
    straight to. Dearest, whatever change the new year brings with it, we
    are together&mdash;I can give you no more of myself&mdash;indeed, you give me
    now (back again if you choose, but changed and renewed by your
    possession) the powers that seemed most properly mine. I could only
    mean that, by the expressions to which you refer&mdash;only could mean that
    you were my crown and palm branch, now and for ever, and so, that it
    was a very indifferent matter to me if the world took notice of that
    fact or no. Yes, dearest, that <i>is</i> the meaning of the prophecy, which
    I was stupidly blind not to have read and taken comfort from long ago.
    You ARE the veritable Siren&mdash;and you 'wait me,' and will sing 'song
    for song.' And this is my first song, my true song&mdash;this love I bear
    you&mdash;I look into my heart and then let it go forth under that
    name&mdash;love. I am more than mistrustful of many other feelings in me:
    they are not earnest enough; so far, not true enough&mdash;but this is all
    the flower of my life which you call forth and which lies at your
    feet.
</p>
<p>
    Now let me say it&mdash;what you are to remember. That if I had the
    slightest doubt, or fear, I would utter it to you on the
    instant&mdash;secure in the incontested stability of the main <i>fact</i>, even
    though the heights at the verge in the distance should tremble and
    prove vapour&mdash;and there would be a deep consolation in your
    forgiveness&mdash;indeed, yes; but I tell you, on solemn consideration, it
    does seem to me that&mdash;once take away the broad and general words that
    admit in their nature of any freight they can be charged with,&mdash;put
    aside love, and devotion, and trust&mdash;and <i>then</i> I seem to have said
    <i>nothing</i> of my feeling to you&mdash;nothing whatever.
</p>
<p>
    I will not write more now on this subject. Believe you are my blessing
    and infinite reward beyond possible desert in intention,&mdash;my life has
    been crowned by you, as I said!
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you ever&mdash;through you I shall be blessed. May I kiss
    your cheek and pray this, my own, all-beloved?
</p>
<p>
    I must add a word or two of other things. I am very well now, quite
    well&mdash;am walking and about to walk. Horne, or rather his friends,
    reside in the very lane Keats loved so much&mdash;Millfield Lane. Hunt lent
    me once the little copy of the first Poems dedicated to him&mdash;and on
    the title-page was recorded in Hunt's delicate characters that 'Keats
    met him with this, the presentation-copy, or whatever was the odious
    name, in M&mdash;&mdash; Lane&mdash;called Poets' Lane by the gods&mdash;Keats came
    running, holding it up in his hand.' Coleridge had an affection for
    the place, and Shelley '<i>knew</i>' it&mdash;and I can testify it is green and
    silent, with pleasant openings on the grounds and ponds, through the
    old trees that line it. But the hills here are far more open and wild
    and hill-like; not with the eternal clump of evergreens and thatched
    summer house&mdash;to say nothing of the 'invisible railing' miserably
    visible everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    You very well know <i>what</i> a vision it is you give me&mdash;when you speak
    of <i>standing up by the table</i> to care for my flowers&mdash;(which I will
    never be ashamed of again, by the way&mdash;I will say for the future;
    'here are my best'&mdash;in this as in other things.) Now, do you remember,
    that once I bade you not surprise me out of my good behaviour by
    standing to meet me unawares, as visions do, some day&mdash;but now&mdash;<i>omne
    ignotum</i>? No, dearest!
</p>
<p>
    Ought I to say there will be two days more? till Saturday&mdash;and if one
    word comes, <i>one</i> line&mdash;think! I am wholly yours&mdash;yours, beloved!

<p style="text-align: right">January 1, 1845 [1846].
</p>
<p>
    How good you are&mdash;how best! it is a favourite play of my memory to
    take up the thought of what you were to me (to my mind gazing!) years
    ago, as the poet in an abstraction&mdash;then the thoughts of you, a little
    clearer, in concrete personality, as Mr. Kenyon's friend, who had
    dined with him on such a day, or met him at dinner on such another,
    and said some great memorable thing 'on Wednesday last,' and enquired
    kindly about <i>me</i> perhaps on Thursday,&mdash;till I was proud! and so, the
    thoughts of you, nearer and nearer (yet still afar!) as the Mr.
    Browning who meant to do me the honour of writing to me, and who did
    write; and who asked me once in a letter (does he remember?) 'not to
    lean out of the window while his foot was on the stair!'&mdash;to take up
    all those thoughts, and more than those, one after another, and tie
    them together with all <i>these</i>, which cannot be named so easily&mdash;which
    cannot be classed in botany and Greek. It is a nosegay of mystical
    flowers, looking strangely and brightly, and keeping their May-dew
    through the Christmases&mdash;better than even <i>your</i> flowers! And I am not
    'ashamed' of mine, ... be very sure! no!
</p>
<p>
    For the siren, I never suggested to you any such thing&mdash;why you do not
    pretend to have read such a suggestion in my letter certainly. <i>That</i>
    would have been most exemplarily modest of me! would it not, O
    Ulysses?
</p>
<p>
    And you meant to write, ... you <i>meant</i>! and went to walk in 'Poet's
    lane' instead, (in the 'Aonius of Highgate') which I remember to have
    read of&mdash;does not Hunt speak of it in his Memoirs?&mdash;and so now there
    is another track of light in the traditions of the place, and people
    may talk of the pomegranate-smell between the hedges. So you really
    have <i>hills</i> at New Cross, and not hills by courtesy? I was at
    Hampstead once&mdash;and there was something attractive to me in that
    fragment of heath with its wild smell, thrown down ... like a Sicilian
    rose from Proserpine's lap when the car drove away, ... into all that
    arid civilization, 'laurel-clumps and invisible visible fences,' as
    you say!&mdash;and the grand, eternal smoke rising up in the distance, with
    its witness against nature! People grew severely in jest about cockney
    landscape&mdash;but is it not true that the trees and grass in the close
    neighbourhood of great cities must of necessity excite deeper emotion
    than the woods and valleys will, a hundred miles off, where human
    creatures ruminate stupidly as the cows do, the 'county families'
    es-<i>chewing</i> all men who are not 'landed proprietors,' and the farmers
    never looking higher than to the fly on the uppermost turnip-leaf! Do
    you know at all what English country-life is, which the English praise
    so, and 'moralize upon into a thousand similes,' as that one greatest,
    purest, noblest thing in the world&mdash;the purely English and excellent
    thing? It is to my mind simply and purely abominable, and I would
    rather live in a street than be forced to live it out,&mdash;that English
    country-life; for I don't mean life in the country. The social
    exigencies&mdash;why, nothing <i>can</i> be so bad&mdash;nothing! That is the way by
    which Englishmen grow up to top the world in their peculiar line of
    respectable absurdities.
</p>
<p>
    Think of my talking so as if I could be vexed with any one of them!
    <i>I!</i>&mdash;On the contrary I wish them all a happy new year to abuse one
    another, or visit each of them his nearest neighbour whom he hates,
    three times a week, because 'the distance is so convenient,' and give
    great dinners in noble rivalship (venison from the Lord Lieutenant
    against turbot from London!), and talk popularity and game-law by
    turns to the tenantry, and beat down tithes to the rector. This
    glorious England of ours; with its peculiar glory of the rural
    districts! And <i>my</i> glory of patriotic virtue, who am so happy in
    spite of it all, and make a pretence of talking&mdash;talking&mdash;while I
    think the whole time of your letter. I think of your letter&mdash;I am no
    more a patriot than <i>that</i>!
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you, best and dearest! You say things to me which I am
    not worthy to listen to for a moment, even if I was deaf dust the next
    moment.... I confess it humbly and earnestly as before God.
</p>
<p>
    Yet He knows,&mdash;if the entireness of a gift means anything,&mdash;that I
    have not given with a reserve, that I am yours in my life and soul,
    for this year and for other years. Let me be used <i>for</i> you rather
    than <i>against</i> you! and that unspeakable, immeasurable grief of
    feeling myself a stone in your path, a cloud in your sky, may I be
    saved from it!&mdash;pray it for <i>me</i> ... for <i>my</i> sake rather than
    <i>yours</i>. For the rest, I thank you, I thank you. You will be always to
    me, what to-day you are&mdash;and that is all!&mdash;!

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Night.<br>
[Post-mark, January 5, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Yesterday, nearly the last thing, I bade you 'think of me'&mdash;I wonder
    if you could misunderstand me in that?&mdash;As if my words or actions or
    any of my ineffectual outside-self <i>should</i> be thought of, unless to
    be forgiven! But I do, dearest, feel confident that while I am in your
    mind&mdash;cared for, rather than thought about&mdash;no great harm can happen
    to me; and as, for great harm to reach me, it must pass through you,
    you will care for yourself; <i>my</i>self, best self!
</p>
<p>
    Come, let us talk. I found Horne's book at home, and have had time to
    see that fresh beautiful things are there&mdash;I suppose 'Delora' will
    stand alone still&mdash;but I got pleasantly smothered with that odd shower
    of wood-spoils at the end, the dwarf-story; cup-masses and fern and
    spotty yellow leaves,&mdash;all that, I love heartily&mdash;and there is good
    sailor-speech in the 'Ben Capstan'&mdash;though he does knock a man down
    with a 'crow-bar'&mdash;instead of a marling-spike or, even, a
    belaying-pin! The first tale, though good, seems least new and
    individual, but I must know more. At one thing I wonder&mdash;his not
    reprinting a quaint clever <i>real</i> ballad, published before 'Delora,'
    on the 'Merry Devil of Edmonton'&mdash;the first of his works I ever read.
    No, the very first piece was a single stanza, if I remember, in which
    was this line: 'When bason-crested Quixote, lean and bold,'&mdash;good, is
    it not? Oh, while it strikes me, good, too, <i>is</i> that 'Swineshead
    Monk' ballad! Only I miss the old chronicler's touch on the method of
    concocting the poison: 'Then stole this Monk into the Garden and under
    a certain herb found out a Toad, which, squeezing into a cup,' &amp;c.
    something to that effect. I suspect, <i>par parenthèse</i>, you have found
    out by this time my odd liking for 'vermin'&mdash;you once wrote '<i>your</i>
    snails'&mdash;and certainly snails are old clients of mine&mdash;but efts! Horne
    traced a line to me&mdash;in the rhymes of a ''prentice-hand' I used to
    look over and correct occasionally&mdash;taxed me (last week) with having
    altered the wise line 'Cold as a <i>lizard</i> in a <i>sunny</i> stream' to
    'Cold as a newt hid in a shady brook'&mdash;for 'what do <i>you</i> know about
    newts?' he asked of the author&mdash;who thereupon confessed. But never try
    and catch a speckled gray lizard when we are in Italy, love, and you
    see his tail hang out of the chink of a wall, his
    winter-house&mdash;because the strange tail will snap off, drop from him
    and stay in your fingers&mdash;and though you afterwards learn that there
    is more desperation in it and glorious determination to be free, than
    positive pain (so people say who have no tails to be twisted off)&mdash;and
    though, moreover, the tail grows again after a sort&mdash;<i>yet</i> ... don't
    do it, for it will give you a thrill! What a fine fellow our English
    water-eft is; 'Triton paludis Linnaei'&mdash;<i>e come guizza</i> (<i>that</i> you
    can't say in another language; cannot preserve the little in-and-out
    motion along with the straightforwardness!)&mdash;I always loved all those
    wild creatures God '<i>sets up for themselves</i>' so independently of us,
    so successfully, with their strange happy minute inch of a candle, as
    it were, to light them; while we run about and against each other with
    our great cressets and fire-pots. I once saw a solitary bee nipping a
    leaf round till it exactly fitted the front of a hole; his nest, no
    doubt; or tomb, perhaps&mdash;'Safe as Oedipus's grave-place, 'mid Colone's
    olives swart'&mdash;(Kiss me, my Siren!)&mdash;Well, it seemed awful to watch
    that bee&mdash;he seemed so <i>instantly</i> from the teaching of God! Ælian
    says that ... a <i>frog</i>, does he say?&mdash;some animal, having to swim
    across the Nile, never fails to provide himself with a bit of reed,
    which he bites off and holds in his mouth transversely and so puts
    from shore gallantly ... because when the water-serpent comes swimming
    to meet him, there is the reed, wider than his serpent's jaws, and no
    hopes of a swallow that time&mdash;now fancy the two meeting heads, the
    frog's wide eyes and the vexation of the snake!
</p>
<p>
    Now, see! do I deceive you? Never say I began by letting down my
    dignity 'that with no middle flight intends to soar above the Aonian
    Mount'!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    My best, dear, dear one,&mdash;may you be better, less <i>depressed</i>, ... I
    can hardly imagine frost reaching you if I could be by you. Think what
    happiness you mean to give me,&mdash;what a life; what a death! 'I may
    change'&mdash;too true; yet, you see, as an eft was to me at the beginning
    so it continues&mdash;I <i>may</i> take up stones and pelt the next I
    see&mdash;but&mdash;do you much fear that?&mdash;Now, <i>walk</i>, move, <i>guizza, anima
    mia dolce</i>. Shall I not know one day how far your mouth will be from
    mine as we walk? May I let that stay ... dearest, (the <i>line</i> stay,
    not the mouth)?
</p>
<p>
    I am not very well to-day&mdash;or, rather, have not been so&mdash;<i>now</i>, I am
    well and <i>with you</i>. I just say that, very needlessly, but for strict
    frankness' sake. Now, you are to write to me soon, and tell me all
    about your self, and to love me ever, as I love you ever, and bless
    you, and leave you in the hands of God&mdash;My own love!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Tell me if I do wrong to send <i>this</i> by a morning post&mdash;so as to reach
    you earlier than the evening&mdash;when you will ... write to me?
</p>
<p>
    Don't let me forget to say that I shall receive the <i>Review</i>
    to-morrow, and will send it directly.

[Post-mark, January 6, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    When you get Mr. Horne's book you will understand how, after reading
    just the first and the last poems, I could not help speaking coldly a
    little of it&mdash;and in fact, estimating his power as much as you can do,
    I did think and do, that the last was unworthy of him, and that the
    first might have been written by a writer of one tenth of his faculty.
    But last night I read the 'Monk of Swineshead Abbey' and the 'Three
    Knights of Camelott' and 'Bedd Gelert' and found them all of different
    stuff, better, stronger, more consistent, and read them with pleasure
    and admiration. Do you remember this application, among the countless
    ones of shadow to the transiency of life? I give the first two lines
    for clearness&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Like to the cloud upon the hill<br>
We are a moment seen<br>
Or the <i>shadow of the windmill-sail<br>
Across yon sunny slope of green</i>.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">New or not, and I don't remember it elsewhere, it is just and
    beautiful I think. Think how the shadow of the windmill-sail just
    touches the ground on a bright windy day! the shadow of a bird flying
    is not faster! Then the 'Three Knights' has beautiful things, with
    more definite and distinct images than he is apt to show&mdash;for his
    character is a vague grand massiveness,&mdash;like Stonehenge&mdash;or at least,
    if 'towers and battlements he sees' they are 'bosomed high' in dusky
    clouds ... it is a 'passion-created imagery' which has no clear
    outline. In this ballad of the 'Knights,' and in the Monk's too, we
    may <i>look at</i> things, as on the satyr who swears by his horns and
    mates not with his kind afterwards, 'While, <i>holding beards</i>, they
    dance in pairs&mdash;and that is all excellent and reminds one of those
    fine sylvan festivals, 'in Orion.' But now tell me if you like
    altogether 'Ben Capstan' and if you consider the sailor-idiom to be
    lawful in poetry, because I do not indeed. On the same principle we
    may have Yorkshire and Somersetshire 'sweet Doric'; and do recollect
    what it ended in of old, in the Blowsibella heroines. Then for the Elf
    story ... why should such things be written by men like Mr. Horne? I
    am vexed at it. Shakespeare and Fletcher did not write so about
    fairies:&mdash;Drayton did not. Look at the exquisite 'Nymphidia,' with its
    subtle sylvan consistency, and then at the lumbering coarse ...
    '<i>machina intersit</i>' ... Grandmama Grey!&mdash;to say nothing of the 'small
    dog' that isn't the 'small boy.' Mr. Horne succeeds better on a larger
    canvass, and with weightier material; with blank verse rather than
    lyrics. He cannot make a fine stroke. He wants subtlety and elasticity
    in the thought and expression. Remember, I admire him honestly and
    earnestly. No one has admired more than I the 'Death of Marlowe,'
    scenes in 'Cosmo,' and 'Orion' in much of it. But now tell me if you
    can accept with the same stretched out hand all these lyrical poems? I
    am going to write to him as much homage as can come truly. Who
    combines different faculties as you do, striking the whole octave? No
    one, at present in the world.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, after you went away yesterday and I began to consider, I
    found that there was nothing to be so over-glad about in the matter
    of the letters, for that, Sunday coming next to Saturday, the best now
    is only as good as the worst before, and I can't hear from you, until
    Monday ... Monday! Did you think of <i>that</i>&mdash;you who took the credit of
    acceding so meekly! I shall not praise you in return at any rate. I
    shall have to wait ... till what o'clock on Monday, tempted in the
    meanwhile to fall into controversy against the 'new moons and sabbath
    days' and the pausing of the post in consequence.
</p>
<p>
    You never guessed perhaps, what I look back to at this moment in the
    physiology of our intercourse, the curious double feeling I had about
    you&mdash;you personally, and you as the writer of these letters, and the
    crisis of the feeling, when I was positively vexed and jealous of
    myself for not succeeding better in making a unity of the two. I could
    not! And moreover I could not help but that the writer of the letters
    seemed nearer to me, long ... long ... and in spite of the postmark,
    than did the personal visitor who confounded me, and left me
    constantly under such an impression of its being all dream-work on his
    side, that I have stamped my feet on this floor with impatience to
    think of having to wait so many hours before the 'candid' closing
    letter could come with its confessional of an illusion. 'People say,'
    I used to think, 'that women <i>always</i> know, and certainly I do not
    know, and therefore ... therefore.'&mdash;The logic crushed on like
    Juggernaut's car. But in the letters it was different&mdash;the dear
    letters took me on the side of my own ideal life where I was able to
    stand a little upright and look round. I could read such letters for
    ever and answer them after a fashion ... that, I felt from the
    beginning. But <i>you</i>&mdash;!
</p>
<p>
    <i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Never too early can the light come. Thank you for my
    letter! Yet you look askance at me over 'newt and toad,' and praise so
    the Elf-story that I am ashamed to send you my ill humour on the same
    head. And you really like <i>that</i>? admire it? Grandmama Grey and the
    night cap and all? and 'shoetye and blue sky?' and is it really wrong
    of me to like certainly some touches and images, but not the whole,
    ... not the poem as a whole? I can take delight in the fantastical,
    and in the grotesque&mdash;but here there is a want of life and
    consistency, as it seems to me!&mdash;the elf is no elf and speaks no
    elf-tongue: it is not the right key to touch, ... this, ... for
    supernatural music. So I fancy at least&mdash;but I will try the poem again
    presently. You must be right&mdash;unless it should be your over-goodness
    opposed to my over-badness&mdash;I will not be sure. Or you wrote perhaps
    in an accidental mood of most excellent critical smoothness, such as
    Mr. Forster did his last <i>Examiner</i> in, when he gave the all-hail to
    Mr. Harness as one of the best dramatists of the age!! Ah no!&mdash;not
    such as Mr. Forster's. Your soul does not enter into his secret&mdash;There
    can be nothing in common between you. For him to say such a word&mdash;he
    who knows&mdash;or ought to know!&mdash;And now let us agree and admire the
    bowing of the old ministrel over Bedd Gelert's unfilled grave&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">The <i>long</i> beard <i>fell</i> like <i>snow</i> into the grave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With solemn grace
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">A poet, a friend, a generous man Mr. Horne is, even if no laureate for
    the fairies.
</p>
<p>
    I have this moment a parcel of books via Mr. Moxon&mdash;Miss Martineau's
    two volumes&mdash;and Mr. Bailey sends his 'Festus,' very kindly, ... and
    'Woman in the Nineteenth Century' from America from a Mrs. or a Miss
    Fuller&mdash;how I hate those 'Women of England,' 'Women and their Mission'
    and the rest. As if any possible good were to be done by such
    expositions of rights and wrongs.
</p>
<p>
    Your letter would be worth them all, if <i>you</i> were less <i>you</i>! I mean,
    just this letter, ... all alive as it is with crawling buzzing
    wriggling cold-blooded warm-blooded creatures ... as all alive as your
    own pedant's book in the tree. And do you know, I think I like frogs
    too&mdash;particularly the very little leaping frogs, which are so
    high-hearted as to emulate the birds. I remember being scolded by my
    nurses for taking them up in my hands and letting them leap from one
    hand to the other. But for the toad!&mdash;why, at the end of the row of
    narrow beds which we called our gardens when we were children, grew an
    old thorn, and in the hollow of the root of the thorn, lived a toad, a
    great ancient toad, whom I, for one, never dared approach too nearly.
    That he 'wore a jewel in his head' I doubted nothing at all. You must
    see it glitter if you stooped and looked steadily into the hole. And
    on days when he came out and sate swelling his black sides, I never
    looked steadily; I would run a hundred yards round through the shrubs,
    deeper than knee-deep in the long wet grass and nettles, rather than
    go past him where he sate; being steadily of opinion, in the
    profundity of my natural history-learning, that if he took it into his
    toad's head to spit at me I should drop down dead in a moment,
    poisoned as by one of the Medici.
</p>
<p>
    Oh&mdash;and I had a field-mouse for a pet once, and should have joined my
    sisters in a rat's nest if I had not been ill at the time (as it was,
    the little rats were tenderly smothered by over-love!): and
    blue-bottle flies I used to feed, and hated your spiders for them; yet
    no, not much. My aversion proper ... call it horror rather ... was for
    the silent, cold, clinging, gliding <i>bat</i>; and even now, I think, I
    could not sleep in the room with that strange bird-mouse-creature, as
    it glides round the ceiling silently, silently as its shadow does on
    the floor. If you listen or look, there is not a wave of the wing&mdash;the
    wing never waves! A bird without a feather! a beast that flies! and so
    cold! as cold as a fish! It is the most supernatural-seeming of
    natural things. And then to see how when the windows are open at night
    those bats come sailing ... without a sound&mdash;and go ... you cannot
    guess where!&mdash;fade with the night-blackness!
</p>
<p>
    You have not been well&mdash;which is my first thought if not my first
    word. Do walk, and do not work; and think ... what I could be thinking
    of, if I did not think of <i>you</i> ... dear&mdash;dearest! 'As the doves fly
    to the windows,' so I think of you! As the prisoners think of liberty,
    as the dying think of Heaven, so I think of you. When I look up
    straight to God ... nothing, no one, used to intercept me&mdash;now there
    is <i>you</i>&mdash;only you under him! Do not use such words as those therefore
    any more, nor say that you are not to be thought of so and so. You are
    to be thought of every way. You must know what you are to me if you
    know at all what <i>I</i> am,&mdash;and what I should be but for you.
</p>
<p>
    So ... love me a little, with the spiders and the toads and the
    lizards! love me as you love the efts&mdash;and I will believe in <i>you</i> as
    you believe ... in Ælian&mdash;Will <i>that</i> do?

<p>
    But, my sweet, there is safer going in letters than in visits, do you
    not see? In the letter, one may go to the utmost limit of one's
    supposed tether without danger&mdash;there is the distance so palpably
    between the most audacious step <i>there</i>, and the next ... which is
    nowhere, seeing it is not in the letter. Quite otherwise in personal
    intercourse, where any indication of turning to a certain path, even,
    might possibly be checked not for its own fault but lest, the path
    once reached and proceeded in, some other forbidden turning might come
    into sight, we will say. In the letter, all ended <i>there</i>, just there
    ... and you may think of that, and forgive; at all events, may avoid
    speaking irrevocable words&mdash;and when, as to me, those words are
    intensely <i>true, doom-words</i>&mdash;think, dearest! Because, as I told you
    once, what most characterizes my feeling for you is the perfect
    <i>respect</i> in it, the full <i>belief</i> ... (I shall get presently to poor
    Robert's very avowal of 'owing you all esteem'!). It is on that I
    build, and am secure&mdash;for how should I know, of myself, how to serve
    you and be properly yours if it all was to be learnt by my own
    interpreting, and what you professed to dislike you were to be
    considered as wishing for, and what liking, as it seemed, you were
    loathing at your heart, and if so many 'noes' made a 'yes,' and 'one
    refusal no rebuff' and all that horrible bestiality which stout
    gentlemen turn up the whites of their eyes to, when they rise after
    dinner and pressing the right hand to the left side say, 'The toast be
    dear woman!' Now, love, with this feeling in me from the beginning,&mdash;I
    do believe,&mdash;<i>now</i>, when I am utterly blest in this gift of your love,
    and least able to imagine what I should do without it,&mdash;I cannot but
    believe, I say, that had you given me once a 'refusal'&mdash;clearly
    derived from your own feelings, and quite apart from any fancied
    consideration for my interests; had this come upon me, whether slowly
    but inevitably in the course of events, or suddenly as precipitated by
    any step of mine; I should, <i>believing you</i>, have never again renewed
    directly or indirectly such solicitation; I should have begun to count
    how many other ways were yet open to serve you and devote myself to
    you ... but from <i>the outside</i>, now, and not in your livery! Now, if I
    should have acted thus under <i>any</i> circumstances, how could I but
    redouble my endeavours at precaution after my own foolish&mdash;you know,
    and forgave long since, and I, too, am forgiven in my own eyes, for
    the cause, though not the manner&mdash;but could I do other than keep
    'farther from you' than in the letters, dearest? For your own part in
    that matter, seeing it with all the light you have since given me (and
    <i>then</i>, not inadequately by my own light) I could, I do kiss your
    feet, kiss every letter in your name, bless you with my whole heart
    and soul if I could pour them out, from me, before you, to stay and be
    yours; when I think on your motives and pure perfect generosity. It
    was the plainness of <i>that</i> which determined me to wait and be patient
    and grateful and your own for ever in any shape or capacity you might
    please to accept. Do you think that because I am so rich now, I could
    not have been most rich, too, <i>then</i>&mdash;in what would seem little only
    to <i>me</i>, only with this great happiness? I should have been proud
    beyond measure&mdash;happy past all desert, to call and be allowed to see
    you simply, speak with you and be spoken to&mdash;what am I more than
    others? Don't think this mock humility&mdash;<i>it is not</i>&mdash;you take me in
    your mantle, and we shine together, but I know my part in it! All this
    is written breathlessly on a sudden fancy that you <i>might</i>&mdash;if not
    now, at some future time&mdash;give other than this, the true reason, for
    that discrepancy you see, that nearness in the letters, that early
    farness in the visits! And, love, all love is but a passionate
    <i>drawing closer</i>&mdash;I would be one with you, dearest; let my soul press
    close to you, as my lips, dear life of my life.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;You are entirely right about those poems of Horne's&mdash;I
    spoke only of the effect of the first glance, and it is a principle
    with me to begin by welcoming any strangeness, intention of
    originality in men&mdash;the other way of safe copying precedents being
    <i>so</i> safe! So I began by praising all that was at all questionable in
    the form ... reserving the ground-work for after consideration. The
    Elf-story turns out a pure mistake, I think&mdash;and a common mistake,
    too. Fairy stories, the good ones, were written for men and women,
    and, being true, pleased also children; now, people set about writing
    for children and miss them and the others too,&mdash;with that detestable
    irreverence and plain mocking all the time at the very wonder they
    profess to want to excite. All obvious bending down to the lower
    capacity, determining not to be the great complete man one is, by
    half; any patronizing minute to be spent in the nursery over the books
    and work and healthful play, of a visitor who will presently bid
    good-bye and betake himself to the Beefsteak Club&mdash;keep us from all
    that! The Sailor Language is good in its way; but as wrongly used in
    Art as real clay and mud would be, if one plastered them in the
    foreground of a landscape in order to attain to so much truth, at all
    events&mdash;the true thing to endeavour is the making a golden colour
    which shall do every good in the power of the dirty brown. Well, then,
    what a veering weathercock am I, to write so and now, <i>so</i>! Not
    altogether,&mdash;for first it was but the stranger's welcome I gave, the
    right of every new comer who must stand or fall by his behaviour once
    admitted within the door. And then&mdash;when I know what Horne thinks
    of&mdash;you, dearest; how he knew you first, and from the soul admired
    you; and how little he thinks of my good fortune ... I <i>could</i> <SPAN class="sc-ex">not</span>
    begin by giving you a bad impression of anything he sends&mdash;he has such
    very few rewards for a great deal of hard excellent enduring work, and
    <i>none</i>, no reward, I do think, would he less willingly forego than
    your praise and sympathy. But your opinion once expressed&mdash;truth
    remains the truth&mdash;so, at least, I excuse myself ... and quite as much
    for what I say <i>now</i> as for what was said <i>then</i>! 'King John' is very
    fine and full of purpose; 'The Noble Heart,' sadly faint and
    uncharacteristic. The chief incident, too, turns on that poor
    conventional fallacy about what constitutes a proper wrong to
    resist&mdash;a piece of morality, after a different standard, is introduced
    to complete another fashioned morality&mdash;a segment of a circle of
    larger dimensions is fitted into a smaller one. Now, you may have your
    own standard of morality in this matter of resistance to wrong, how
    and when if at all. And you may quite understand and sympathize with
    quite different standards innumerable of other people; but go from one
    to the other abruptly, you cannot, I think. 'Bear patiently all
    injuries&mdash;revenge in no case'&mdash;that is plain. 'Take what you conceive
    to be God's part, do his evident work, stand up for good and destroy
    evil, and co-operate with this whole scheme here'&mdash;<i>that</i> is plain,
    too,&mdash;but, call Otto's act <i>no</i> wrong, or being one, not such as
    should be avenged&mdash;and then, call the remark of a stranger that one is
    a 'recreant'&mdash;just what needs the slight punishment of instant death
    to the remarker&mdash;and ... where is the way? What <i>is</i> clear?
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;Not my letter! which goes on and on&mdash;'dear letters'&mdash;sweetest?
    because they cost all the precious labour of making out? Well, I shall
    see you to-morrow, I trust. Bless you, my own&mdash;I have not half said
    what was to say even in the letter I thought to write, and which
    proves only what you see! But at a thought I fly off with you, 'at a
    cock-crow from the Grange.'&mdash;Ever your own.
</p>
<p>
    Last night, I received a copy of the <i>New Quarterly</i>&mdash;now here is
    popular praise, a sprig of it! Instead of the attack I supposed it to
    be, from my foolish friend's account, the notice is outrageously
    eulogistical, a stupidly extravagant laudation from first to last&mdash;and
    in <i>three other</i> articles, as my sister finds by diligent fishing,
    they introduce my name with the same felicitous praise (except one
    instance, though, in a good article by Chorley I am certain); and
    <i>with</i> me I don't know how many poetical <i>crétins</i> are praised as
    noticeably&mdash;and, in the turning of a page, somebody is abused in the
    richest style of scavengering&mdash;only Carlyle! And I love him enough not
    to envy him nor wish to change places, and giving him mine, mount into
    his.
</p>
<p>
    All which, let me forget in the thoughts of to-morrow! Bless you, my
    Ba.

</p>
<p>
    But some things are indeed said very truly, and as I like to read
    them&mdash;of <i>you</i>, I mean of course,&mdash;though I quite understand that it
    is doing no manner of good to go back so to 'Paracelsus,' heading the
    article 'Paracelsus and other poems,' as if the other poems could not
    front the reader broadly by a divine right of their own. 'Paracelsus'
    is a great work and will <i>live</i>, but the way to do you good with the
    stiffnecked public (such good as critics can do in their degree) would
    have been to hold fast and conspicuously the gilded horn of the last
    living crowned creature led by you to the altar, saying 'Look <i>here</i>.'
    What had he to do else, as a critic? Was he writing for the
    <i>Retrospective Review</i>? And then, no attempt at analytical
    criticism&mdash;or a failure, at the least attempt! all slack and in
    sentences! Still these are right things to say, true things, worthy
    things, said of you as a poet, though your poems do not find justice:
    and I like, for my own part, the issuing from my cathedral into your
    great world&mdash;the outermost temple of divinest consecration. I like
    that figure and association, and none the worse for its being a
    sufficient refutation of what he dared to impute, of your poetical
    sectarianism, in another place&mdash;<i>yours</i>!
</p>
<p>
    For me, it is all quite kind enough&mdash;only I object, on my own part
    also, to being reviewed in the 'Seraphim,' when my better books are
    nearer: and also it always makes me a little savage when people talk
    of Tennysonianisms! I have faults enough as the Muses know,&mdash;but let
    them be <i>my</i> faults! When I wrote the 'Romaunt of Margret,' I had not
    read a line of Tennyson. I came from the country with my eyes only
    half open, and he had not penetrated where I had been living and
    sleeping: and in fact when I afterwards tried to reach him here in
    London, nothing could be found except one slim volume, so that, till
    the collected works appeared ... <i>favente</i> Moxon, ... I was ignorant
    of his best <i>early</i> productions; and not even for the rhythmetical
    form of my 'Vision of the Poets,' was I indebted to the 'Two
    Voices,'&mdash;three pages of my 'Vision' having been written several years
    ago&mdash;at the beginning of my illness&mdash;and thrown aside, and taken up
    again in the spring of 1844. Ah, well! there's no use talking! In a
    solitary review which noticed my 'Essay on Mind,' somebody wrote ...
    'this young lady imitates Darwin'&mdash;and I never could <i>read</i> Darwin,
    ... was stopped always on the second page of the 'Loves of the Plants'
    when I tried to read him to 'justify myself in having an opinion'&mdash;the
    repulsion was too strong. Yet the 'young lady imitated Darwin' of
    course, as the infallible critic said so.
</p>
<p>
    And who are Mr. Helps and Miss Emma Fisher and the 'many others,'
    whose company brings one down to the right plebeianism? The 'three
    poets in three distant ages born' may well stare amazed!
</p>
<p>
    After all you shall not by any means say that I upset the inkstand on
    your review in a passion&mdash;because pray mark that the ink has over-run
    some of your praises, and that if I had been angry to the overthrow of
    an inkstand, it would not have been precisely <i>there</i>. It is the
    second book spoilt by me within these two days&mdash;and my fingers were so
    dabbled in blackness yesterday that to wring my hands would only have
    made matters worse. Holding them up to Mr. Kenyon they looked dirty
    enough to befit a poetess&mdash;as black 'as bard beseemed'&mdash;and he took
    the review away with him to read and save it from more harm.
</p>
<p>
    How could it be that you did not get my letter which would have
    reached you, I thought, on Monday evening, or on Tuesday at the very
    very earliest?&mdash;and how is it that I did not hear from you last night
    again when I was unreasonable enough to expect it? is it true that you
    <i>hate</i> writing to me?
</p>
<p>
    At that word, comes the review back from dear Mr. Kenyon, and the
    letter which I enclose to show you how it accounts reasonably for the
    ink&mdash;I did it 'in a pet,' he thinks! And I ought to buy you a new
    book&mdash;certainly I ought&mdash;only it is not worth doing justice for&mdash;and I
    shall therefore send it back to you spoilt as it is; and you must
    forgive me as magnanimously as you can.
</p>
<p>
    'Omne ignotum pro magnifico'&mdash;do you think <i>so</i>? I hope not indeed!
    <i>vo quietando</i>&mdash;and everything else that I ought to do&mdash;except of
    course, <i>that</i> thinking of you which is so difficult.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. Till to-morrow!
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your own always.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon refers to 'Festus'&mdash;of which I had said that the fine
    things were worth looking for, in the design manqué.

<p style="text-align: right">Friday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, January 9, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You never think, ever dearest, that I 'repent'&mdash;why what a word to
    use! You never could <i>think</i> such a word for a moment! If you were to
    leave me even,&mdash;to decide that it is best for you to do it, and do
    it,&mdash;I should accede at once of course, but never should I nor could I
    'repent' ... regret anything ... be sorry for having known you and
    loved you ... no! Which I say simply to prove that, in <i>no</i> extreme
    case, could I repent for my own sake. For yours, it might be
    different.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Not</i> out of 'generosity' certainly, but from the veriest selfishness,
    I choose here, before God, any possible present evil, rather than the
    future consciousness of feeling myself less to you, on the whole, than
    another woman might have been.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, these vain and most heathenish repetitions&mdash;do I not vex you by
    them, <i>you</i> whom I would always please, and never vex? Yet they force
    their way because you are the best noblest and dearest in the world,
    and because your happiness is so precious a thing.
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Cloth of frieze, be not too bold,<br>
Though thou'rt matched with cloth of gold!
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">&mdash;<i>that</i>, beloved, was written for <i>me</i>. And you, if you would make me
    happy, <i>always</i> will look at yourself from my ground and by my light,
    as I see you, and consent to be selfish in all things. Observe, that
    if I were <i>vacillating</i>, I should not be so weak as to tease you with
    the process of the vacillation: I should wait till my pendulum ceased
    swinging. It is precisely because I am your own, past any retraction
    or wish of retraction,&mdash;because I belong to you by gift and ownership,
    and am ready and willing to prove it before the world at a word of
    yours,&mdash;it is precisely for this, that I remind you too often of the
    necessity of using this right of yours, not to your injury, of being
    wise and strong for both of us, and of guarding your happiness which
    is mine. I have said these things ninety and nine times over, and over
    and over have you replied to them,&mdash;as yesterday!&mdash;and now, do not
    speak any more. It is only my preachment for general use, and not for
    particular application,&mdash;only to be <i>ready</i> for application. I love
    you from the deepest of my nature&mdash;the whole world is nothing to me
    beside you&mdash;and what is so precious, is not far from being terrible.
    'How <i>dreadful</i> is this place.'
</p>
<p>
    To hear you talk yesterday, is a gladness in the thought for
    to-day,&mdash;it was with such a full assent that I listened to every word.
    It is true, I think, that we see things (things apart from ourselves)
    under the same aspect and colour&mdash;and it is certainly true that I have
    a sort of instinct by which I seem to know your views of such subjects
    as we have never looked at together. I know <i>you</i> so well (yes, I
    boast to myself of that intimate knowledge), that I seem to know also
    the <i>idola</i> of all things as they are in your eyes&mdash;so that never,
    scarcely, I am curious,&mdash;never anxious, to learn what your opinions
    may be. Now, <i>have</i> I been curious or anxious? It was enough for me to
    know <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
    More than enough! You have 'left undone'&mdash;do you say? On the contrary,
    you have done too much,&mdash;you <i>are</i> too much. My cup,&mdash;which used to
    hold at the bottom of it just the drop of Heaven dew mingling with the
    absinthus,&mdash;has overflowed all this wine: and <i>that</i> makes me look out
    for the vases, which would have held it better, had you stretched out
    your hand for them.
</p>
<p>
    Say how you are&mdash;and do take care and exercise&mdash;and write to me,
    dearest!

<p>
    How right you are about 'Ben Capstan,'&mdash;and the illustration by the
    <i>yellow clay</i>. That is precisely what I meant,&mdash;said with more
    precision than I could say it. Art without an ideal is neither nature
    nor art. The question involves the whole difference between Madame
    Tussaud and Phidias.
</p>
<p>
    I have just received Mr. Edgar Poe's book&mdash;and I see that the
    deteriorating preface which was to have saved me from the vanity-fever
    produceable by the dedication, is cut down and away&mdash;perhaps in this
    particular copy only!

<p>
    Tuesday is so near, as men count, that I caught myself just now being
    afraid lest the week should have no chance of appearing long to you!

<p>
    I cannot write my feelings in this large writing, begun on such a
    scale for the Review's sake; and just now&mdash;there is no denying it, and
    spite of all I have been incredulous about&mdash;it does seem that the fact
    <i>is</i> achieved and that I <i>do</i> love you, plainly, surely, more than
    ever, more than any day in my life before. It is your secret, the why,
    the how; the experience is mine. What are you doing to me?&mdash;in the

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 10, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Kindest and dearest you are!&mdash;that is 'my secret' and for the others,
    I leave them to you!&mdash;only it is no secret that I should and must be
    glad to have the words you sent with the book,&mdash;which I should have
    seen at all events be sure, whether you had sent it or not. Should I
    not, do you think? And considering what the present generation of
    critics really is, the remarks on you may stand, although it is the
    dreariest impotency to complain of the want of flesh and blood and of
    human sympathy in general. Yet suffer them to say on&mdash;it is the stamp
    on the critical knife. There must be something eminently stupid, or
    farewell criticdom! And if anything more utterly untrue could be said
    than another, it is precisely that saying, which Mr. Mackay stands up
    to catch the reversion of! Do you indeed suppose that Heraud could
    have done this? I scarcely can believe it, though some things are said
    rightly as about the 'intellectuality,' and how you stand first by the
    brain,&mdash;which is as true as truth can be. Then, I <i>shall have
    'Pauline' in a day or two</i>&mdash;yes, I shall and must, and <i>will</i>.
</p>
<p>
    The 'Ballad Poems and Fancies,' the article calling itself by that
    name, seems indeed to be Mr. Chorley's, and is one of his very best
    papers, I think. There is to me a want of colour and thinness about
    his writings in general, with a grace and <i>savoir faire</i> nevertheless,
    and always a rightness and purity of intention. Observe what he says
    of 'many-sidedness' seeming to trench on opinion and principle. That,
    he means for himself I know, for he has said to me that through having
    such largeness of sympathy he has been charged with want of
    principle&mdash;yet 'many-sidedness' is certainly no word for him. The
    effect of general sympathies may be evolved both from an elastic fancy
    and from breadth of mind, and it seems to me that he rather <i>bends</i> to
    a phase of humanity and literature than contains it&mdash;than comprehends
    it. Every part of a truth implies the whole; and to accept truth all
    round, does not mean the recognition of contradictory things:
    universal sympathies cannot make a man inconsistent, but, on the
    contrary, sublimely consistent. A church tower may stand between the
    mountains and the sea, looking to either, and stand fast: but the
    willow-tree at the gable-end, blown now toward the north and now
    toward the south while its natural leaning is due east or west, is
    different altogether ... <i>as</i> different as a willow-tree from a church
    tower.
</p>
<p>
    Ah, what nonsense! There is only one truth for me all this time, while
    I talk about truth and truth. And do you know, when you have told me
    to think of you, I have been feeling ashamed of thinking of you so
    much, of thinking of only you&mdash;which <i>is</i> too much, perhaps. Shall I
    tell you? it seems to me, to myself, that no man was ever before to
    any woman what you are to me&mdash;the fulness must be in proportion, you
    know, to the vacancy ... and only <i>I</i> know what was behind&mdash;the long
    wilderness <i>without</i> the blossoming rose ... and the capacity for
    happiness, like a black gaping hole, before this silver flooding. Is
    it wonderful that I should stand as in a dream, and disbelieve&mdash;not
    <i>you</i>&mdash;but my own fate? Was ever any one taken suddenly from a
    lampless dungeon and placed upon the pinnacle of a mountain, without
    the head turning round and the heart turning faint, as mine do? And
    you love me <i>more</i>, you say?&mdash;Shall I thank you or God?
    Both,&mdash;indeed&mdash;and there is no possible return from me to either of
    you! I thank you as the unworthy may ... and as we all thank God. How
    shall I ever prove what my heart is to you? How will you ever see it
    as I feel it? I ask myself in vain.
</p>
<p>
    Have so much faith in me, my only beloved, as to use me simply for
    your own advantage and happiness, and to your own ends without a
    thought of any others&mdash;<i>that</i> is all I could ask you with any disquiet
    as to the granting of it&mdash;May God bless you!&mdash;

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 12, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    I have no words for you, my dearest,&mdash;I shall never have.
</p>
<p>
    You are mine, I am yours. Now, here is one sign of what I said ...
    that I must love you more than at first ... a little sign, and to be
    looked narrowly for or it escapes me, but then the increase it shows
    <i>can</i> only be little, so very little now&mdash;and as the fine French
    Chemical Analysts bring themselves to appreciate matter in its refined
    stages by <i>millionths</i>, so&mdash;! At first I only thought of being <i>happy</i>
    in you,&mdash;in your happiness: now I most think of you in the dark hours
    that must come&mdash;I shall grow old with you, and die with you&mdash;as far as
    I can look into the night I see the light with me. And surely with
    that provision of comfort one should turn with fresh joy and renewed
    sense of security to the sunny middle of the day. I am in the full
    sunshine now; and <i>after</i>, all seems cared for,&mdash;is it too homely an
    illustration if I say the day's visit is not crossed by uncertainties
    as to the return through the wild country at nightfall?&mdash;Now Keats
    speaks of 'Beauty, that must <i>die</i>&mdash;and Joy whose hand is ever at his
    lips, bidding farewell!' And <i>who</i> spoke of&mdash;looking up into the eyes
    and asking 'And <i>how long</i> will you love us'?&mdash;There is a Beauty that
    will not die, a Joy that bids no farewell, dear dearest eyes that will
    love for ever!
</p>
<p>
    And <i>I</i>&mdash;am to love no longer than I can. Well, dear&mdash;and when I <i>can</i>
    no longer&mdash;you will not blame me? You will do only as ever, kindly and
    justly; hardly more. I do not pretend to say I have chosen to put my
    fancy to such an experiment, and consider how <i>that</i> is to happen, and
    what measures ought to be taken in the emergency&mdash;because in the
    'universality of my sympathies' I certainly number a very lively one
    with my own heart and soul, and cannot amuse myself by such a
    spectacle as their supposed extinction or paralysis. There is no doubt
    I should be an object for the deepest commiseration of you or any more
    fortunate human being. And I hope that because such a calamity does
    not obtrude itself on me as a thing to be prayed against, it is no
    less duly implied with all the other visitations from which no
    humanity can be altogether exempt&mdash;just as God bids us ask for the
    continuance of the 'daily bread'!&mdash;'battle, murder and sudden death'
    lie behind doubtless. I repeat, and perhaps in so doing only give one
    more example of the instantaneous conversion of that indignation we
    bestow in another's case, into wonderful lenity when it becomes our
    own, ... that I only contemplate the <i>possibility</i> you make me
    recognize, with pity, and fear ... no anger at all; and imprecations
    of vengeance, <i>for what</i>? Observe, I only speak of cases <i>possible</i>;
    of sudden impotency of mind; that <i>is</i> possible&mdash;there <i>are</i> other
    ways of '<i>changing</i>,' 'ceasing to love' &amp;c. which it is safest not to
    think of nor believe in. A man <i>may</i> never leave his writing desk
    without seeing safe in one corner of it the folded slip which directs
    the disposal of his papers in the event of his reason suddenly leaving
    him&mdash;or he may never go out into the street without a card in his
    pocket to signify his address to those who may have to pick him up in
    an apoplectic fit&mdash;but if he once begins to fear he is growing a glass
    bottle, and, <i>so</i>, liable to be smashed,&mdash;do you see? And now, love,
    dear heart of my heart, my own, only Ba&mdash;see no more&mdash;see what I <i>am</i>,
    what God in his constant mercy ordinarily grants to those who have, as
    I, received already so much; much, past expression! It is but&mdash;if you
    will so please&mdash;at worst, forestalling the one or two years, for my
    sake; but you <i>will</i> be as sure of me <i>one</i> day as I can be now of
    myself&mdash;and why not <i>now</i> be sure? See, love&mdash;a year is gone by&mdash;we
    were in one relation when you wrote at the end of a letter 'Do not say
    I do not tire you' (by writing)&mdash;'<i>I am sure I do</i>.' A year has gone
    by&mdash;<i>Did you tire me then?</i> <i>Now</i>, you tell me what is told; for my
    sake, sweet, let the few years go by; we are married, and my arms are
    round you, and my face touches yours, and I am asking you, '<i>Were you
    not</i> to me, in that dim beginning of 1846, a joy behind all joys, a
    life added to and transforming mine, the good I choose from all the
    possible gifts of God on this earth, for which I seemed to have lived;
    which accepting, I thankfully step aside and let the rest get what
    they can; what, it is very likely, they esteem more&mdash;for why should my
    eye be evil because God's is good; why should I grudge that, giving
    them, I do believe, infinitely less, he gives them a content in the
    inferior good and belief in its worth? I should have wished <i>that</i>
    further concession, that illusion as I believe it, for their
    sakes&mdash;but I cannot undervalue my own treasure and so scant the only
    tribute of mere gratitude which is in my power to pay. Hear this said
    <i>now before</i> the few years; and believe in it <i>now for then</i>, dearest!
</p>
<p>
    Must you see 'Pauline'? At least then let me wait a few days; to
    correct the misprints which affect the sense, and to write you the
    history of it; what is necessary you should know before you see it.
    That article I suppose to be by Heraud&mdash;about two thirds&mdash;and the
    rest, or a little less, by that Mr. Powell&mdash;whose unimaginable,
    impudent vulgar stupidity you get some inkling of in the 'Story from
    Boccaccio'&mdash;of which the <i>words</i> quoted were <i>his</i>, I am sure&mdash;as sure
    as that he knows not whether Boccaccio lived before or after
    Shakspeare, whether Florence or Rome be the more northern city,&mdash;one
    word of Italian in general, or letter of Boccaccio's in particular.
    When I took pity on him once on a time and helped his verses into a
    sort of grammar and sense, I did not think he was a <i>buyer</i> of other
    men's verses, to be printed as his own; thus he <i>bought</i> two
    modernisations of Chaucer&mdash;'Ugolino' and another story from Leigh
    Hunt&mdash;and one, 'Sir Thopas' from Horne, and printed them as his own,
    as I learned only last week. He paid me extravagant court and, seeing
    no harm in the mere folly of the man, I was on good terms with him,
    till ten months ago he grossly insulted a friend of mine who had
    written an article for the Review&mdash;(which is as good as <i>his</i>, he
    being a large proprietor of the delectable property, and influencing
    the voices of his co-mates in council)&mdash;well, he insulted my friend,
    who had written that article at my special solicitation, and did all
    he could to avoid paying the price of it&mdash;Why?&mdash;Because the poor
    creature had actually taken the article to the Editor <i>as one by his
    friend Serjeant Talfourd contributed for pure love of him, Powell the
    aforesaid</i>,&mdash;cutting, in consequence, no inglorious figure in the eyes
    of Printer and Publisher! Now I was away all this time in Italy or he
    would never have ventured on such a piece of childish impertinence.
    And my friend being a true gentleman, and quite unused to this sort of
    'practice,' in the American sense, held his peace and went without his
    'honorarium.' But on my return, I enquired, and made him make a
    proper application, which Mr. Powell treated with all the insolence in
    the world&mdash;because, as the event showed, the having to write a cheque
    for 'the Author of <i>the</i> Article'&mdash;that author's name <i>not</i> being
    Talfourd's ... <i>there</i> was certain disgrace! Since then (ten months
    ago) I have never seen him&mdash;and he accuses <i>himself</i>, observe, of
    'sucking my plots while I drink his tea'&mdash;one as much as the other!
    And now why do I tell you this, all of it? Ah,&mdash;now you shall hear!
    Because, it has often been in my mind to ask you what <i>you</i> know of
    this Mr. Powell, or ever knew. For he, (being profoundly versed in
    every sort of untruth, as every fresh experience shows me, and the
    rest of his acquaintance) he told me long ago, 'he used to correspond
    with you, and that he quarrelled with you'&mdash;which I supposed to mean
    that he began by sending you his books (as with one and everybody) and
    that, in return to your note of acknowledgment, he had chosen to write
    again, and perhaps, again&mdash;is it so? Do not write one word in answer
    to me&mdash;the name of such a miserable nullity, and husk of a man, ought
    not to have a place in your letters&mdash;and <i>that way</i> he would get near
    to me again; near indeed this time!&mdash;So <i>tell</i> me, in a word&mdash;or do
    not tell me.
</p>
<p>
    How I never say what I sit down to say! How saying the little makes me
    want to say the more! How the least of little things, once taken up as
    a thing to be imparted to you, seems to need explanations and
    commentaries; all is of importance to me&mdash;every breath you breathe,
    every little fact (like this) you are to know!
</p>
<p>
    I was out last night&mdash;to see the rest of Frank Talfourd's theatricals;
    and met Dickens and his set&mdash;so my evenings go away! If I do not bring
    the <i>Act</i> you must forgive me&mdash;yet I shall, I think; the roughness
    matters little in this stage. Chorley says very truly that a tragedy
    implies as much power <i>kept back</i> as brought out&mdash;very true that is. I
    do not, on the whole, feel dissatisfied&mdash;as was to be but
    expected&mdash;with the effect of this last&mdash;the <i>shelve</i> of the hill,
    whence the end is seen, you continuing to go down to it, so that at
    the very last you may pass off into a plain and so away&mdash;not come to a
    stop like your horse against a church wall. It is all in long
    speeches&mdash;the <i>action, proper</i>, is in them&mdash;they are no descriptions,
    or amplifications&mdash;but here, in a drama of this kind, all the
    <i>events</i>, (and interest), take place in the <i>minds</i> of the actors ...
    somewhat like 'Paracelsus' in that respect. You know, or don't know,
    that the general charge against me, of late, from the few quarters I
    thought it worth while to listen to, has been that of abrupt,
    spasmodic writing&mdash;they will find some fault with this, of course.
</p>
<p>
    How you know Chorley! That is precisely the man, that willow blowing
    now here now there&mdash;precisely! I wish he minded the <i>Athenæum</i>, its
    silence or eloquence, no more nor less than I&mdash;but he goes on
    painfully plying me with invitation after invitation, only to show me,
    I feel confident, that <i>he</i> has no part nor lot in the matter: I have
    <i>two</i> kind little notes asking me to go on Thursday and Saturday. See
    the absurd position of us both; he asks more of my presence than he
    can want, just to show his own kind feeling, of which I do not doubt;
    and I must try and accept more hospitality than suits me, only to
    prove my belief in that same! For myself&mdash;if I have vanity which such
    Journals can raise; would the praise of them raise it, they who
    praised Mr. Mackay's own, own 'Dead Pan,' quite his own, the other
    day?&mdash;By the way, Miss Cushman informed me the other evening that the
    gentleman had written a certain 'Song of the Bell' ... 'singularly
    like Schiller's; <i>considering that Mr. M. had never</i> seen it!' I am
    told he writes for the <i>Athenæum</i>, but don't know. Would that sort of
    praise be flattering, or his holding the tongue&mdash;which Forster, deep
    in the mysteries of the craft, corroborated my own notion about&mdash;as
    pure willingness to hurt, and confessed impotence and little clever
    spite, and enforced sense of what may be safe at the last? You shall
    see they will not notice&mdash;unless a fresh publication alters the
    circumstances&mdash;until some seven or eight months&mdash;as before; and then
    they <i>will</i> notice, and <i>praise</i>, and tell anybody who cares to
    enquire, '<i>So</i> we noticed the work.' So do not you go expecting
    justice or injustice till I tell you. It answers me to be found
    writing so, so anxious to prove I understand the laws of the game,
    when that game is only 'Thimble-rig' and for prizes of
    gingerbread-nuts&mdash;Prize or no prize, Mr. Dilke <i>does</i> shift the pea,
    and so did from the beginning&mdash;as Charles Lamb's pleasant <i>sobriquet</i>
    (Mr. <i>Bilk</i>, he would have it) testifies. Still he behaved kindly to
    that poor Frances Brown&mdash;let us forget him.
</p>
<p>
    And now, my Audience, my crown-bearer, my path-preparer&mdash;I am with you
    again and out of them all&mdash;there, <i>here</i>, in my arms, is my <i>proved
    palpable success</i>! My life, my poetry, gained nothing, oh no!&mdash;but
    this found them, and blessed them. On Tuesday I shall see you,
    dearest&mdash;am much better; well to-day&mdash;are you well&mdash;or 'scarcely to be
    called an invalid'? Oh, when I <i>have</i> you, am by you&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Bless you, dearest&mdash;And be very sure you have your wish about the
    length of the week&mdash;still Tuesday must come! And with it your own,
    happy, grateful

[Post-mark, January 14, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ah Mr. Kenyon!&mdash;how he vexed me to-day. To keep away all the ten days
    before, and to come just at the wrong time after all! It was better
    for you, I suppose&mdash;believe&mdash;to go with him down-stairs&mdash;yes, it
    certainly was better: it was disagreeable enough to be very wise! Yet
    I, being addicted to every sort of superstition turning to melancholy,
    did hate so breaking off in the middle of that black thread ... (do
    you remember what we were talking of when they opened the door?) that
    I was on the point of saying 'Stay one moment,' which I should have
    repented afterwards for the best of good reasons. Oh, I <i>should</i> have
    liked to have 'fastened off' that black thread, and taken one stitch
    with a blue or a green one!
</p>
<p>
    You do not remember what we were talking of? what <i>you</i>, rather, were
    talking of? And what <i>I</i> remember, at least, because it is exactly the
    most unkind and hard thing you ever said to me&mdash;ever dearest, so I
    remember it by that sign! That you should say such a thing to me&mdash;!
    think what it was, for indeed I will not write it down here&mdash;it would
    be worse than Mr. Powell! Only the foolishness of it (I mean, the
    foolishness of it alone) saves it, smooths it to a degree!&mdash;the
    foolishness being the same as if you asked a man where he would walk
    when he lost his head. Why, if you had asked St. Denis <i>beforehand</i>,
    he would have thought it a foolish question.
</p>
<p>
    And you!&mdash;you, who talk so finely of never, never doubting; of being
    such an example in the way of believing and trusting&mdash;it appears,
    after all, that you have an imagination apprehensive (or
    comprehensive) of 'glass bottles' like other sublunary creatures, and
    worse than some of them. For mark, that I never went any farther than
    to the stone-wall hypothesis of your forgetting me!&mdash;<i>I</i> always
    stopped there&mdash;and never climbed, to the top of it over the
    broken-bottle fortification, to see which way you meant to walk
    afterwards. And you, to ask me so coolly&mdash;think what you asked me.
    That you should have the heart to ask such a question!
</p>
<p>
    And the reason&mdash;! and it could seem a reasonable matter of doubt to
    you whether I would go to the south for my health's sake!&mdash;And I
    answered quite a common 'no' I believe&mdash;for you bewildered me for the
    moment&mdash;and I have had tears in my eyes two or three times since, just
    through thinking back of it all ... of your asking me such questions.
    Now did I not tell you when I first knew you, that I was leaning out
    of the window? True, <i>that</i> was&mdash;I was tired of living ...
    unaffectedly tired. All I cared to live for was to do better some of
    the work which, after all, was out of myself, and which I had to reach
    across to do. But I told you. Then, last year, for duty's sake I would
    have <i>consented</i> to go to Italy! but if you really fancy that I would
    have struggled in the face of all that difficulty&mdash;or struggled,
    indeed, anywise, to compass such an object as <i>that</i>&mdash;except for the
    motive of your caring for it and me&mdash;why you know nothing of me after
    all&mdash;nothing! And now, take away the motive, and I am where I
    was&mdash;leaning out of the window again. To put it in plainer words (as
    you really require information), I should let them do what they liked
    to me till I was dead&mdash;only I <i>wouldn't go to Italy</i>&mdash;if anybody
    proposed Italy out of contradiction. In the meantime I do entreat you
    never to talk of such a thing to me any more.
</p>
<p>
    You know, if you were to leave me by your choice and for your
    happiness, it would be another thing. It would be very lawful to talk
    of <i>that</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And observe! I perfectly understand that you did not think of
    <i>doubting me</i>&mdash;so to speak! But you thought, all the same, that if
    such a thing happened, I should be capable of doing so and so.
</p>
<p>
    Well&mdash;I am not quarrelling&mdash;I am uneasy about your head rather. That
    pain in it&mdash;what can it mean? I do beseech you to think of me just so
    much as will lead you to take regular exercise every day, never
    missing a day; since to walk till you are tired on Tuesday and then
    not to walk at all until Friday is <i>not</i> taking exercise, nor the
    thing required. Ah, if you knew how dreadfully natural every sort of
    evil seems to my mind, you would not laugh at me for being afraid. I
    do beseech you, dearest! And then, Sir John Hanmer invited you,
    besides Mr. Warburton, and suppose you went to <i>him</i> for a very little
    time&mdash;just for the change of air? or if you went to the coast
    somewhere. Will you consider, and do what is right, <i>for me</i>? I do not
    propose that you should go to Italy, observe, nor any great thing at
    which you might reasonably hesitate. And&mdash;did you ever try smoking as
    a remedy? If the nerves of the head chiefly are affected it might do
    you good, I have been thinking. Or without the smoking, to breathe
    where tobacco is burnt,&mdash;<i>that</i> calms the nervous system in a
    wonderful manner, as I experienced once myself when, recovering from
    an illness, I could not sleep, and tried in vain all sorts of
    narcotics and forms of hop-pillow and inhalation, yet was
    tranquillized in one half hour by a <i>pinch</i> of <i>tobacco</i> being burnt
    in a shovel near me. Should you mind it very much? the trying I mean?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;For '<i>Pauline</i>'&mdash;when I had named it to you I was on the
    point of sending for the book to the booksellers&mdash;then suddenly I
    thought to myself that I should wait and hear whether you very, very
    much would dislike my reading it. See now! Many readers have done
    virtuously, but <i>I</i>, (in this virtue I tell you of) surpassed them
    all!&mdash;And now, because I may, I '<i>must</i> read it':&mdash;and as there are
    misprints to be corrected, will you do what is necessary, or what you
    think is necessary, and bring me the book on Monday? Do not
    send&mdash;bring it. In the meanwhile I send back the review which I forgot
    to give to you yesterday in the confusion. Perhaps you have not read
    it in your house, and in any case there is no use in my keeping it.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I hear from you, I wonder! Oh my vain thoughts, that will not
    keep you well! And, ever since you have known me, you have been
    worse&mdash;<i>that</i>, you confess!&mdash;and what if it should be the crossing of
    my bad star? <i>You</i> of the 'Crown' and the 'Lyre,' to seek influences
    from the 'chair of Cassiopeia'! I hope she will forgive me for using
    her name so! I might as well have compared her to a professorship of
    poetry in the university of Oxford, according to the latest election.
    You know, the qualification, there, is,&mdash;<i>not to be a poet</i>.
</p>
<p>
    How vexatious, yesterday! The stars (talking of <i>them</i>) were out of
    spherical tune, through the damp weather, perhaps, and that scarlet
    sun was a sign! First Mr. Chorley!&mdash;and last, dear Mr. Kenyon; who
    <i>will</i> say tiresome things without any provocation. Did you walk with
    him his way, or did he walk with you yours? or did you only walk
    down-stairs together?
</p>
<p>
    Write to me! Remember that it is a month to Monday. Think of your very
    own, who bids God bless you when she prays best for herself!&mdash;
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.B.B.
</p>
<p>
    Say particularly how you are&mdash;now do not omit it. And will you have
    Miss Martineau's books when I can lend them to you? Just at this
    moment I <i>dare</i> not, because they are reading them here.
</p>
<p>
    Let Mr. Mackay have his full proprietary in his 'Dead Pan'&mdash;which is
    quite a different conception of the subject, and executed in blank
    verse too. I have no claims against him, I am sure!
</p>
<p>
    But for the <i>man</i>!&mdash;To call him a poet! A prince and potentate of
    Commonplaces, such as he is!&mdash;I have seen his name in the <i>Athenæum</i>
    attached to a lyric or two ... poems, correctly called fugitive,&mdash;more
    than usually fugitive&mdash;but I never heard before that his hand was in
    the prose department.

</p>
<p>
    Was I in the wrong, dearest, to go away with Mr. Kenyon? I <i>well knew
    and felt</i> the price I was about to pay&mdash;but the thought <i>did</i> occur
    that he might have been informed my probable time of departure was
    that of his own arrival&mdash;and that he would not know how very soon,
    alas, I should be <i>obliged</i> to go&mdash;so ... to save you any least
    embarrassment in the world, I got&mdash;just that shake of the hand, just
    that look&mdash;and no more! And was it all for nothing, all needless after
    all? So I said to myself all the way home.
</p>
<p>
    When I am away from you&mdash;a crowd of things press on me for
    utterance&mdash;'I will say them, not write them,' I think:&mdash;when I see
    you&mdash;all to be said seems insignificant, irrelevant,&mdash;'they can be
    written, at all events'&mdash;I think <i>that</i> too. So, feeling so much, I
    say so little!
</p>
<p>
    I have just returned from Town and write for the Post&mdash;but <i>you</i> mean
    to write, I trust.
</p>
<p>
    <i>That</i> was not obtained, that promise, to be happy with, as last time!

<p>
    How are you?&mdash;tell me, dearest; a long week is to be waited now!

</p>
<p>
    Dearest, dearer to my heart minute by minute, I had no wish to give
    you pain, God knows. No one can more readily consent to let a few
    years more or less of life go out of account,&mdash;be lost&mdash;but as I sate
    by you, you so full of the truest life, for this world as for the
    next,&mdash;and was struck by the possibility, all that might happen were I
    away, in the case of your continuing to acquiesce&mdash;dearest, it <i>is</i>
    horrible&mdash;could not but speak. If in drawing you, all of you, closer
    to my heart, I hurt you whom I would&mdash;<i>outlive</i> ... yes,&mdash;cannot speak
    here&mdash;forgive me, Ba.
</p>
<p>
    My Ba, you are to consider now for me. Your health, your strength, it
    is all wonderful; that is not my dream, you know&mdash;but what all see.
    Now, steadily care for us both&mdash;take time, take counsel if you choose;
    but at the end tell me what you will do for your part&mdash;thinking of me
    as utterly devoted, soul and body, to you, living wholly in your life,
    seeing good and ill only as you see,&mdash;being yours as your hand is,&mdash;or
    as your Flush, rather. Then I will, on my side, prepare. When I say
    'take counsel'&mdash;I reserve my last right, the man's right of first
    speech. <i>I</i> stipulate, too, and require to say my own speech in my own
    words or by letter&mdash;remember! But this living without you is too
    tormenting now. So begin thinking,&mdash;as for Spring, as for a New Year,
    as for a new life.
</p>
<p>
    I went no farther than the door with Mr. Kenyon. He must see the
    truth; and&mdash;you heard the playful words which had a meaning all the
    same.
</p>
<p>
    No more of this; only, think of it for me, love!
</p>
<p>
    One of these days I shall write a long letter&mdash;on the omitted matters,
    unanswered questions, in your past letters. The present joy still
    makes me ungrateful to the previous one; but I remember. We are to
    live together one day, love!
</p>
<p>
    Will you let Mr. Poe's book lie on the table on Monday, if you please,
    that I may read what he <i>does</i> say, with my own eyes? <i>That</i> I meant
    to ask, too!
</p>
<p>
    How too, too kind you are&mdash;how you care for so little that affects me!
    I am very much better&mdash;I went out yesterday, as you found: to-day I
    shall walk, beside seeing Chorley. And certainly, certainly I would go
    away for a week, if so I might escape being ill (and away from you) a
    fortnight; but I am <i>not</i> ill&mdash;and will care, as you bid me, beloved!
    So, you will send, and take all trouble; and all about that crazy
    Review! Now, you should not!&mdash;I will consider about your goodness. I
    hardly know if I care to read that kind of book just now.
</p>
<p>
    Will you, and must you have 'Pauline'? If I could pray you to revoke
    that decision! For it is altogether foolish and <i>not</i> boylike&mdash;and I
    shall, I confess, hate the notion of running over it&mdash;yet commented
    it must be; more than mere correction! I was unluckily
    <i>precocious</i>&mdash;but I had rather you <i>saw</i> real infantine efforts
    (verses at six years old, and drawings still earlier) than this
    ambiguous, feverish&mdash;Why not wait? When you speak of the
    'Bookseller'&mdash;I smile, in glorious security&mdash;having a whole bale of
    sheets at the house-top. He never knew my name even!&mdash;and I withdrew
    these after a very little time.
</p>
<p>
    And now&mdash;here is a vexation. May I be with you (for this once) next
    Monday, at <i>two</i> instead of <i>three</i> o'clock? Forster's business with
    the new Paper obliges him, he says, to restrict his choice of days to
    <i>Monday</i> next&mdash;and give up <i>my</i> part of Monday I will never for fifty
    Forsters&mdash;now, sweet, mind that! Monday is no common day, but leads to
    a <i>Saturday</i>&mdash;and if, as I ask, I get leave to call at 2&mdash;and to stay
    till 3-1/2&mdash;though I then lose nearly half an hour&mdash;yet all will be
    comparatively well. If there is any difficulty&mdash;one word and I
    re-appoint our party, his and mine, for the day the paper breaks
    down&mdash;not so long to wait, it strikes me!
</p>
<p>
    Now, bless you, my precious Ba&mdash;I am your own&mdash;
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;Your own R.

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, January 17, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Our letters have crossed; and, mine being the longest, I have a right
    to expect another directly, I think. I have been calculating: and it
    seems to me&mdash;now what I am going to say may take its place among the
    paradoxes,&mdash;that I gain most by the short letters. Last week the only
    long one came last, and I was quite contented that the 'old friend'
    should come to see you on Saturday and make you send me two instead of
    the single one I looked for: it was a clear gain, the little short
    note, and the letter arrived all the same. I remember, when I was a
    child, liking to have two shillings and sixpence better than half a
    crown&mdash;and now it is the same with this fairy money, which will never
    turn all into pebbles, or beans, whatever the chronicles may say of
    precedents.
</p>
<p>
    Arabel did tell Mr. Kenyon (she told me) that 'Mr. Browning would soon
    go away'&mdash;in reply to an observation of his, that 'he would not stay
    as I had company'; and altogether it was better,&mdash;the lamp made it
    look late. But you do not appear in the least remorseful for being
    tempted of my black devil, my familiar, to ask such questions and
    leave me under such an impression&mdash;'mens conscia recti' too!!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And Mr. Kenyon will not come until next Monday perhaps. How am I? But
    I am too well to be asked about. Is it not a warm summer? The weather
    is as 'miraculous' as the rest, I think. It is you who are unwell and
    make people uneasy, dearest. Say how you are, and promise me to do
    what is right and try to be better. The walking, the changing of the
    air, the leaving off Luria ... do what is right, I earnestly beseech
    you. The other day, I heard of Tennyson being ill again, ... too ill
    to write a simple note to his friend Mr. Venables, who told George. A
    little more than a year ago, it would have been no worse a thing to me
    to hear of your being ill than to hear of his being ill!&mdash;How the
    world has changed since then! To <i>me</i>, I mean.
</p>
<p>
    Did I say <i>that</i> ever ... that 'I knew you must be tired?' And it was
    not even so true as that the coming event threw its shadow before?
</p>
<p>
    <i>Thursday night.</i>&mdash;I have begun on another sheet&mdash;I could not write
    here what was in my heart&mdash;yet I send you this paper besides to show
    how I was writing to you this morning. In the midst of it came a
    female friend of mine and broke the thread&mdash;the visible thread, that
    is.
</p>
<p>
    And now, even now, at this safe eight o'clock, I could not be safe
    from somebody, who, in her goodnature and my illfortune, must come and
    sit by me&mdash;and when my letter was come&mdash;'why wouldn't I read it? What
    wonderful politeness on my part.' She would not and could not consent
    to keep me from reading my letter. She would stand up by the fire
    rather.
</p>
<p>
    No, no, three times no. Brummel got into the carriage before the
    Regent, ... (didn't he?) but I persisted in not reading my letter in
    the presence of my friend. A notice on my punctiliousness may be put
    down to-night in her 'private diary.' I kept the letter in my hand and
    only read it with those sapient ends of the fingers which the
    mesmerists make so much ado about, and which really did seem to touch
    a little of what was inside. Not <i>all</i>, however, happily for me! Or my
    friend would have seen in my eyes what <i>they</i> did not see.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you! Did I ever say that I had an objection to read the
    verses at six years old&mdash;or see the drawings either? I am reasonable,
    you observe! Only, 'Pauline,' I must have <i>some day</i>&mdash;why not without
    the emendations? But if you insist on them, I will agree to wait a
    little&mdash;if you promise <i>at last</i> to let me see the book, which I will
    not show. Some day, then! you shall not be vexed nor hurried for the
    day&mdash;some day. Am I not generous? And <i>I</i> was 'precocious' too, and
    used to make rhymes over my bread and milk when I was nearly a baby
    ... only really it was mere echo-verse, that of mine, and had nothing
    of mark or of indication, such as I do not doubt that yours had. I
    used to write of virtue with a large 'V,' and 'Oh Muse' with a harp,
    and things of that sort. At nine years old I wrote what I called 'an
    epic'&mdash;and at ten, various tragedies, French and English, which we
    used to act in the nursery. There was a French 'hexameter' tragedy on
    the subject of Regulus&mdash;but I cannot even smile to think of it now,
    there are so many grave memories&mdash;which time has made grave&mdash;hung
    around it. How I remember sitting in 'my house under the sideboard,'
    in the dining-room, concocting one of the soliloquies beginning
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Que suis je? autrefois un général Remain:<br>
Maintenant esclave de Carthage je souffre en vain.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">Poor Regulus!&mdash;Can't you conceive how fine it must have been
    altogether? And these were my 'maturer works,' you are to understand,
    ... and 'the moon was bright at ten o'clock at night' years before. As
    to the gods and goddesses, I believed in them all quite seriously, and
    reconciled them to Christianity, which I believed in too after a
    fashion, as some greater philosophers have done&mdash;and went out one day
    with my pinafore full of little sticks (and a match from the
    housemaid's cupboard) to sacrifice to the blue-eyed Minerva who was my
    favourite goddess on the whole because she cared for Athens. As soon
    as I began to doubt about my goddesses, I fell into a vague sort of
    general scepticism, ... and though I went on saying 'the Lord's
    prayer' at nights and mornings, and the 'Bless all my kind friends'
    afterwards, by the childish custom ... yet I ended this liturgy with a
    supplication which I found in 'King's Memoirs' and which took my fancy
    and met my general views exactly.... 'O God, if there be a God, save
    my soul if I have a soul.' Perhaps the theology of many thoughtful
    children is scarcely more orthodox than this: but indeed it is
    wonderful to myself sometimes how I came to escape, on the whole, as
    well as I have done, considering the commonplaces of education in
    which I was set, with strength and opportunity for breaking the bonds
    all round into liberty and license. Papa used to say ... 'Don't read
    Gibbon's history&mdash;it's not a proper book. Don't read "Tom Jones"&mdash;and
    none of the books on <i>this</i> side, mind!' So I was very obedient and
    never touched the books on <i>that</i> side, and only read instead Tom
    Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and Voltaire's 'Philosophical Dictionary,'
    and Hume's 'Essays,' and Werther, and Rousseau, and Mary
    Wollstonecraft ... books, which I was never suspected of looking
    towards, and which were not 'on <i>that</i> side' certainly, but which did
    as well.
</p>
<p>
    How I am writing!&mdash;And what are the questions you did not answer? I
    shall remember them by the answers I suppose&mdash;but your letters always
    have a fulness to me and I never seem to wish for what is not in them.
</p>
<p>
    But this is the end <i>indeed</i>.

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Thursday Night.<br>
[In the same envelope with the preceding letter.]
</p>
<p>
    Ever dearest&mdash;how you can write touching things to me; and how my
    whole being vibrates, as a string, to these! How have I deserved from
    God and you all that I thank you for? Too unworthy I am of all! Only,
    it was not, dearest beloved, what you feared, that was 'horrible,' it
    was what you <i>supposed</i>, rather! It was a mistake of yours. And now we
    will not talk of it any more.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Friday morning.</i>&mdash;For the rest, I will think as you desire: but I
    have thought a great deal, and there are certainties which I know; and
    I hope we <i>both</i> are aware that nothing can be more hopeless than our
    position in some relations and aspects, though you do not guess
    perhaps that the very approach to the subject is shut up by dangers,
    and that from the moment of a suspicion entering <i>one</i> mind, we should
    be able to meet never again in this room, nor to have intercourse by
    letter through the ordinary channel. I mean, that letters of yours,
    addressed to me here, would infallibly be stopped and destroyed&mdash;if
    not opened. Therefore it is advisable to hurry on nothing&mdash;on these
    grounds it is advisable. What should I do if I did not see you nor
    hear from you, without being able to feel that it was for your
    happiness? What should I do for a month even? And then, I might be
    thrown out of the window or its equivalent&mdash;I look back shuddering to
    the dreadful scenes in which poor Henrietta was involved who never
    offended as I have offended ... years ago which seem as present as
    to-day. She had forbidden the subject to be referred to until that
    consent was obtained&mdash;and at a word she gave up all&mdash;at a word. In
    fact she had no true attachment, as I observed to Arabel at the
    time&mdash;a child never submitted more meekly to a revoked holiday. Yet
    how she was made to suffer. Oh, the dreadful scenes! and only because
    she had seemed to feel a little. I told you, I think, that there was
    an obliquity&mdash;an eccentricity, or something beyond&mdash;on one class of
    subjects. I hear how her knees were made to ring upon the floor, now!
    she was carried out of the room in strong hysterics, and I, who rose
    up to follow her, though I was quite well at that time and suffered
    only by sympathy, fell flat down upon my face in a fainting-fit.
    Arabel thought I was dead.
</p>
<p>
    I have tried to forget it all&mdash;but now I must remember&mdash;and throughout
    our intercourse <i>I have remembered</i>. It is necessary to remember so
    much as to avoid such evils as are inevitable, and for this reason I
    would conceal nothing from you. Do <i>you</i> remember, besides, that there
    can be no faltering on my 'part,' and that, if I should remain well,
    which is not proved yet, I will do for you what you please and as you
    please to have it done. But there is time for considering!
</p>
<p>
    Only ... as you speak of 'counsel,' I will take courage to tell you
    that my <i>sisters know</i>, Arabel is in most of my confidences, and being
    often in the room with me, taxed me with the truth long ago&mdash;she saw
    that I was affected from some cause&mdash;and I told her. We are as safe
    with both of them as possible ... and they thoroughly understand that
    <i>if there should be any change it would not be your fault</i>.... I made
    them understand that thoroughly. From themselves I have received
    nothing but the most smiling words of kindness and satisfaction (I
    thought I might tell you so much), they have too much tenderness for
    me to fail in it now. My brothers, it is quite necessary not to draw
    into a dangerous responsibility. I have felt that from the beginning,
    and shall continue to feel it&mdash;though I hear and can observe that they
    are full of suspicions and conjectures, which are never unkindly
    expressed. I told you once that we held hands the faster in this house
    for the weight over our heads. But the absolute <i>knowledge</i> would be
    dangerous for my brothers: with my sisters it is different, and I
    could not continue to conceal from <i>them</i> what they had under their
    eyes; and then, Henrietta is in a like position. It was not wrong of
    me to let them know it?&mdash;no?
</p>
<p>
    Yet of what consequence is all this to the other side of the question?
    What, if <i>you</i> should give pain and disappointment where you owe such
    pure gratitude. But we need not talk of these things now. Only you
    have more to consider than <i>I</i>, I imagine, while the future comes on.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, let me have my way in one thing: let me see you on <i>Tuesday</i>
    instead of on Monday&mdash;on Tuesday at the old hour. Be reasonable and
    consider. Tuesday is almost as near as the day before it; and on
    Monday, I shall be hurried at first, lest Papa should be still in the
    house, (no harm, but an excuse for nervousness: and I can't quote a
    noble Roman as you can, to the praise of my conscience!) and <i>you</i>
    will be hurried at last, lest you should not be in time for Mr.
    Forster. On the other hand, I will not let you be rude to the <i>Daily
    News</i>, ... no, nor to the <i>Examiner</i>. Come on Tuesday, then, instead
    of Monday, and let us have the usual hours in a peaceable way,&mdash;and if
    there is no obstacle,&mdash;that is, if Mr. Kenyon or some equivalent
    authority should not take note of your being here on Tuesday, why you
    can come again on the Saturday afterwards&mdash;I do not see the
    difficulty. Are we agreed? On Tuesday, at three o'clock. Consider,
    besides, that the Monday arrangement would hurry you in every manner,
    and leave you fagged for the evening&mdash;no, I will not hear of it. Not
    on my account, not on yours!
</p>
<p>
    Think of me on Monday instead, and write before. Are not these two
    lawful letters? And do not they deserve an answer?
</p>
<p>
    My life was ended when I knew you, and if I survive myself it is for
    your sake:&mdash;<i>that</i> resumes all my feelings and intentions in respect
    to you. No 'counsel' could make the difference of a grain of dust in
    the balance. It <i>is so</i>, and not otherwise. If you changed towards me,
    it would be better for you I believe&mdash;and I should be only where I was
    before. While you do <i>not</i> change, I look to you for my first
    affections and my first duty&mdash;and nothing but your bidding me, could
    make me look away.
</p>
<p>
    In the midst of this, Mr. Kenyon came and I felt as if I could not
    talk to him. No&mdash;he does not 'see how it is.' He may have passing
    thoughts sometimes, but they do not stay long enough to produce&mdash;even
    an opinion. He asked if you had been here long.
</p>
<p>
    It may be wrong and ungrateful, but I do wish sometimes that the world
    were away&mdash;even the good Kenyon-aspect of the world.
</p>
<p>
    And so, once more&mdash;may God bless you!
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am wholly yours&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    <i>Tuesday</i>, remember! And say that you agree.

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 17, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Did my own Ba, in the prosecution of her studies, get to a book on the
    forb&mdash;no, <i>un</i>forbidden shelf&mdash;wherein Voltaire pleases to say that
    'si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer'? I feel, after
    reading these letters,&mdash;as ordinarily after seeing you, sweetest, or
    hearing from you,&mdash;that if <i>marriage</i> did not exist, I should
    infallibly <i>invent</i> it. I should say, no words, no <i>feelings</i> even,
    do justice to the whole conviction and <i>religion</i> of my soul&mdash;and
    though they may be suffered to represent some one minute's phase of
    it, yet, in their very fulness and passion they do injustice to the
    <i>unrepresented, other minute's</i>, depth and breadth of love ... which
    let my whole life (I would say) be devoted to telling and proving and
    exemplifying, if not in one, then in another way&mdash;let me have the
    plain palpable power of this; the assured time for this ... something
    of the satisfaction ... (but for the fantasticalness of the
    illustration) ... something like the earnestness of some suitor in
    Chancery if he could once get Lord Lyndhurst into a room with him, and
    lock the door on them both, and know that his whole story <i>must</i> be
    listened to now, and the 'rights of it,'&mdash;dearest, the love unspoken
    now you are to hear 'in all time of our tribulation, in all time of
    our wealth ... at the hour of death, and'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    If I did not <i>know</i> this was so,&mdash;nothing would have been said, or
    sought for. Your friendship, the perfect pride in it, the wish for,
    and eager co-operation in, your welfare, all that is different, and,
    seen now, nothing.
</p>
<p>
    I will care for it no more, dearest&mdash;I am wedded to you now. I believe
    no human being could love you more&mdash;that thought consoles me for my
    own imperfection&mdash;for when <i>that</i> does strike me, as so often it will,
    I turn round on my pursuing self, and ask 'What if it were a claim
    then, what is in Her, demanded rationally, equitably, in return for
    what were in you&mdash;do you like <i>that</i> way!'&mdash;And I do <i>not</i>, Ba&mdash;you,
    even, might not&mdash;when people everyday buy improveable ground, and
    eligible sites for building, and don't want every inch filled up,
    covered over, done to their hands! So take me, and make me what you
    can and will&mdash;and though never to be <i>more</i> yours, yet more <i>like</i>
    you, I may and must be&mdash;Yes, indeed&mdash;best, only love!
</p>
<p>
    And am I not grateful to your sisters&mdash;entirely grateful for that
    crowning comfort; it is 'miraculous,' too, if you please&mdash;for <i>you</i>
    shall know me by finger-tip intelligence or any art magic of old or
    new times&mdash;but they do not see me, know me&mdash;and must moreover be
    jealous of you, chary of you, as the daughters of Hesperus, of
    wonderers and wistful lookers up at the gold apple&mdash;yet instead of
    'rapidly levelling eager eyes'&mdash;they are indulgent? Then&mdash;shall I wish
    capriciously they were <i>not</i> your sisters, not so near you, that there
    might be a kind of grace in loving them for it'&mdash;but what grace can
    there be when ... yes, I will tell you&mdash;<i>no</i>, I will not&mdash;it is
    foolish!&mdash;and it is <i>not</i> foolish in me to love the table and chairs
    and vases in your room.
</p>
<p>
    Let me finish writing to-morrow; it would not become me to utter a
    word against the arrangement&mdash;and Saturday promised, too&mdash;but though
    all concludes against the early hour on Monday, yet&mdash;but this is
    wrong&mdash;on Tuesday it shall be, then,&mdash;thank you, dearest! you let me
    keep up the old proper form, do you not?&mdash;I shall continue to thank,
    and be gratified &amp;c. as if I had some untouched fund of thanks at my
    disposal to cut a generous figure with on occasion! And so, now, for
    your kind considerateness thank <i>you ... that I say</i>, which, God
    knows, <i>could</i> not say, if I died ten deaths in one to do you good,
    'you are repaid'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    To-morrow I will write, and answer more. I am pretty well, and will go
    out to-day&mdash;to-night. My Act is done, and copied&mdash;I will bring it. Do
    you see the <i>Athenæum</i>? By Chorley surely&mdash;and kind and satisfactory.
    I did not expect any notice for a long time&mdash;all that about the
    'mist,' 'unchanged manner' and the like is politic concession to the
    Powers that Be ... because he might tell me that and much more with
    his own lips or unprofessional pen, and be thanked into the bargain,
    yet he does not. But I fancy he saves me from a rougher hand&mdash;the long
    extracts answer every purpose&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    There is all to say yet&mdash;to-morrow!
</p>
<p>
    And ever, ever your own; God bless you!

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, January 19, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You may have seen, I put off all the weighty business part of the
    letter&mdash;but I shall do very little with it now. To be sure, a few
    words will serve, because you understand me, and believe in <i>enough</i>
    of me. First, then, I am wholly satisfied, thoroughly made happy in
    your assurance. I would build up an infinity of lives, if I could plan
    them, one on the other, and all resting on you, on your word&mdash;I fully
    believe in it,&mdash;of my feeling, the gratitude, let there be no attempt
    to speak. And for 'waiting'; 'not hurrying',&mdash;I leave all with you
    henceforth&mdash;all you say is most wise, most convincing.
</p>
<p>
    On the saddest part of all,&mdash;silence. You understand, and I can
    understand through you. Do you know, that I never <i>used</i> to dream
    unless indisposed, and rarely then&mdash;(of late I dream of you, but quite
    of late)&mdash;and <i>those</i> nightmare dreams have invariably been of <i>one</i>
    sort. I stand by (powerless to interpose by a word even) and see the
    infliction of tyranny on the unresisting man or beast (generally the
    last)&mdash;and I wake just in time not to die: let no one try this kind of
    experiment on me or mine! Though I have observed that by a felicitous
    arrangement, the man with the whip puts it into use with an old horse
    commonly. I once knew a fine specimen of the boilingly passionate,
    desperately respectable on the Eastern principle that reverences a
    madman&mdash;and this fellow, whom it was to be death to oppose, (some
    bloodvessel was to break)&mdash;he, once at a dinner party at which I was
    present, insulted his wife (a young pretty simple believer in his
    awful immunities from the ordinary terms that keep men in
    order)&mdash;brought the tears into her eyes and sent her from the room ...
    purely to 'show off' in the eyes of his guests ... (all males,
    law-friends &amp;c., he being a lawyer.) This feat accomplished, he, too,
    left us with an affectation of compensating relentment, to 'just say a
    word and return'&mdash;and no sooner was his back to the door than the
    biggest, stupidest of the company began to remark 'what a fortunate
    thing it was that Mr. So-and-so had such a submissive wife&mdash;not one of
    the women who would resist&mdash;that is, attempt to resist&mdash;and so
    exasperate our gentleman into ... Heaven only knew what!' I said it
    <i>was</i>, in one sense, a fortunate thing; because one of these women,
    without necessarily being the lion-tressed Bellona, would richly give
    him his desert, I thought&mdash;'Oh, indeed?' No&mdash;<i>this</i> man was not to be
    opposed&mdash;wait, you might, till the fit was over, and then try what
    kind argument would do&mdash;and so forth to unspeakable nausea. Presently
    we went up-stairs&mdash;there sate the wife with dried eyes, and a smile at
    the tea-table&mdash;and by her, in all the pride of conquest, with her hand
    in his, our friend&mdash;disposed to be very good-natured of course. I
    listened <i>arrectis auribus</i>, and in a minute he said he did not know
    somebody I mentioned. I told him, <i>that</i> I easily conceived&mdash;such a
    person would never condescend to know <i>him</i>, &amp;c., and treated him to
    every consequence ingenuity could draw from that text&mdash;and at the end
    marched out of the room; and the valorous man, who had sate like a
    post, got up, took a candle, followed me to the door, and only said in
    unfeigned wonder, 'What <i>can</i> have possessed you, my <i>dear</i> B?'&mdash;All
    which I as much expected beforehand, as that the above mentioned man
    of the whip keeps quiet in the presence of an ordinary-couraged dog.
    All this is quite irrelevant to <i>the</i> case&mdash;indeed, I write to get rid
    of the thought altogether. But I do hold it the most stringent duty of
    all who can, to stop a condition, a relation of one human being to
    another which God never allowed to exist between Him and ourselves.
    <i>Trees</i> live and die, if you please, and accept will for a law&mdash;but
    with us, all commands surely refer to a previously-implanted
    conviction in ourselves of their rationality and justice. Or why
    declare that 'the Lord <i>is</i> holy, just and good' unless there is
    recognised and independent conception of holiness and goodness, to
    which the subsequent assertion is referable? 'You know what <i>holiness</i>
    is, what it is to be good? Then, He <i>is</i> that'&mdash;not, '<i>that</i> is
    <i>so</i>&mdash;because <i>he</i> is that'; though, of course, when once the converse
    is demonstrated, this, too, follows, and may be urged for practical
    purposes. All God's urgency, so to speak, is on the <i>justice</i> of his
    judgments, <i>rightness</i> of his rule: yet why? one might ask&mdash;if one
    does believe that the rule <i>is</i> his; why ask further?&mdash;Because, his is
    a 'reasonable service,' once for all.
</p>
<p>
    Understand why I turn my thoughts in this direction. If it is indeed
    as you fear, and no endeavour, concession, on my part will avail,
    under any circumstances&mdash;(and by endeavour, I mean all heart and soul
    could bring the flesh to perform)&mdash;in that case, you will not come to
    me with a shadow past hope of chasing.
</p>
<p>
    The likelihood is, I over frighten myself for you, by the involuntary
    contrast with those here&mdash;you allude to them&mdash;if I went with this
    letter downstairs and said simply 'I want this taken to the direction
    to-night, and am unwell and unable to go, will you take it now?' my
    father would not say a word, or rather would say a dozen cheerful
    absurdities about his 'wanting a walk,' 'just having been wishing to
    go out' &amp;c. At night he sits studying my works&mdash;illustrating them (I
    will bring you drawings to make you laugh)&mdash;and <i>yesterday</i> I picked
    up a crumpled bit of paper ... 'his notion of what a criticism on this
    last number ought to be,&mdash;none, that have appeared, satisfying
    him!'&mdash;So judge of what he will say! And my mother loves me just as
    much more as must of necessity be.
</p>
<p>
    Once more, understand all this ... for the clock scares me of a
    sudden&mdash;I meant to say more&mdash;far more.
</p>
<p>
    But may God bless you ever&mdash;my own dearest, my Ba&mdash;

    <i>(Tuesday)</i>
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 19, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Your letter came just after the hope of one had past&mdash;the latest
    Saturday post had gone, they said, and I was beginning to be as vexed
    as possible, looking into the long letterless Sunday. Then, suddenly
    came the knock&mdash;the postman redivivus&mdash;just when it seemed so beyond
    hoping for&mdash;it was half past eight, observe, and there had been a post
    at nearly eight&mdash;suddenly came the knock, and your letter with it. Was
    I not glad, do you think?
</p>
<p>
    And you call the <i>Athenæum</i> 'kind and satisfactory'? Well&mdash;I was angry
    instead. To make us wait so long for an 'article' like <i>that</i>, was not
    over-kind certainly, nor was it 'satisfactory' to class your peculiar
    qualities with other contemporary ones, as if they were not peculiar.
    It seemed to me cold and cautious, from the causes perhaps which you
    mention, but the extracts will work their own way with everybody who
    knows what poetry is, and for others, let the critic do his worst with
    them. For what is said of 'mist' I have no patience because I who know
    when you are obscure and never think of denying it in some of your
    former works, do hold that this last number is as clear and
    self-sufficing to a common understanding, as far as the expression and
    medium goes, as any book in the world, and that Mr. Chorley was bound
    in verity to say so. If I except that one stanza, you know, it is to
    make the general observation stronger. And then 'mist' is an infamous
    word for your kind of obscurity. You never <i>are</i> misty, not even in
    'Sordello'&mdash;never vague. Your graver cuts deep sharp lines,
    always&mdash;and there is an extra-distinctness in your images and
    thoughts, from the midst of which, crossing each other infinitely, the
    general significance seems to escape. So that to talk of a 'mist,'
    when you are obscurest, is an impotent thing to do. Indeed it makes me
    angry.
</p>
<p>
    But the suggested virtue of 'self-renunciation' only made me smile,
    because it is simply nonsense ... nonsense which proves itself to be
    nonsense at a glance. So genius is to renounce itself&mdash;<i>that</i> is the
    new critical doctrine, is it? Now is it not foolish? To recognize the
    poetical faculty of a man, and then to instruct him in
    'self-renunciation' in that very relation&mdash;or rather, to hint the
    virtue of it, and hesitate the dislike of his doing otherwise? What
    atheists these critics are after all&mdash;and how the old heathens
    understood the divinity of gifts better, beyond any comparison. We may
    take shame to ourselves, looking back.
</p>
<p>
    Now, shall I tell you what I did yesterday? It was so warm, so warm,
    the thermometer at 68 in this room, that I took it into my head to
    call it April instead of January, and put on a cloak and walked
    down-stairs into the drawing-room&mdash;walked, mind! Before, I was carried
    by one of my brothers,&mdash;even to the last autumn-day when I went out&mdash;I
    never walked a step for fear of the cold in the passages. But
    yesterday it was so wonderfully warm, and I so strong besides&mdash;it was
    a feat worthy of the day&mdash;and I surprised them all as much as if I had
    walked out of the window instead. That kind dear Stormie, who with all
    his shyness and awkwardness has the most loving of hearts in him, said
    that he was '<i>so</i> glad to see me'!
</p>
<p>
    Well!&mdash;setting aside the glory of it, it would have been as wise
    perhaps if I had abstained; our damp detestable climate reaches us
    otherwise than by cold, and I am not quite as well as usual this
    morning after an uncomfortable feverish night&mdash;not very unwell, mind,
    nor unwell at all in the least degree of consequence&mdash;and I tell you,
    only to show how susceptible I really am still, though 'scarcely an
    invalid,' say the complimenters.
</p>
<p>
    What a way I am from your letter&mdash;that letter&mdash;or seem to be
    rather&mdash;for one may think of one thing and yet go on writing
    distrustedly of other things. So you are 'grateful' to my sisters ...
    <i>you</i>! Now I beseech you not to talk such extravagances; I mean such
    extravagances as words like these <i>imply</i>&mdash;and there are far worse
    words than these, in the letter ... such as I need not put my finger
    on; words which are sense on my lips, but no sense at all on yours,
    and which make me disquietedly sure that you are under an illusion.
    Observe!&mdash;<i>certainly</i> I should not choose to have a '<i>claim</i>,' see!
    Only, what I object to, in 'illusions,' 'miracles,' and things of that
    sort, is the want of continuity common to such. When Joshua caused the
    sun to stand still, it was not for a year even!&mdash;Ungrateful, I am!
</p>
<p>
    And 'pretty well' means 'not well' I am afraid&mdash;or I should be gladder
    still of the new act. You will tell me on Tuesday what 'pretty well'
    means, and if your mother is better&mdash;or I may have a letter
    to-morrow&mdash;dearest! May God bless you!
</p>
<p>
    To-morrow too, at half past three o'clock, how joyful I shall be that
    my 'kind considerateness' decided not to receive you until Tuesday. My
    very kind considerateness, which made me eat my dinner to-day!

<p style="text-align: right">Monday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, January 19, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Love, if you knew but how vexed I was, so very few minutes after my
    note left last night; how angry with the unnecessary harshness into
    which some of the phrases might be construed&mdash;you would forgive me,
    indeed. But, when all is confessed and forgiven, the fact
    remains&mdash;that it would be the one trial I <i>know</i> I should not be able
    to bear; the repetition of these 'scenes'&mdash;intolerable&mdash;not to be
    written of, even my mind <i>refuses</i> to form a clear conception of them.
</p>
<p>
    My own loved letter is come&mdash;and the news; of which the reassuring
    postscript lets the interrupted joy flow on again. Well, and I am not
    to be grateful for that; nor that you <i>do</i> 'eat your dinner'? Indeed
    you will be ingenious to prevent me! I fancy myself meeting you on
    'the stairs'&mdash;stairs and passages generally, and galleries (ah, thou
    indeed!) all, with their picturesque <i>accidents</i>, of landing-places,
    and spiral heights and depths, and sudden turns and visions of half
    open doors into what Quarles calls 'mollitious chambers'&mdash;and above
    all, <i>landing-places</i>&mdash;they are my heart's delight&mdash;I would come upon
    you unaware in a landing-place in my next dream! One day we may walk
    on the galleries round and over the inner court of the Doges' Palace
    at Venice; and read, on tablets against the wall, how such an one was
    banished for an 'enormous dig (intacco) into the public
    treasure'&mdash;another for ... what you are not to know because his
    friends have got chisels and chipped away the record of it&mdash;underneath
    the 'giants' on their stands, and in the midst of the <i>cortile</i> the
    bronze fountains whence the girls draw water.
</p>
<p>
    So <i>you</i> too wrote French verses?&mdash;Mine were of less lofty
    argument&mdash;one couplet makes me laugh now for the reason of its false
    quantity&mdash;I translated the Ode of Alcæus; and the last couplet ran
    thus....
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Harmodius, et toi, cher Aristogiton!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">Comme l'astre du jour, brillera votre nom!
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">The fact was, I could not bear to hurt my French Master's
    feelings&mdash;who inveterately maltreated 'ai's and oi's' and in this
    instance, an 'ei.' But 'Pauline' is altogether of a different sort of
    precocity&mdash;you shall see it when I can master resolution to transcribe
    the explanation which I know is on the fly-leaf of a copy here. Of
    that work, the <i>Athenæum</i> said [several words erased] now, what
    outrageous folly! I care, and you care, precisely nothing about its
    sayings and doings&mdash;yet here I talk!
</p>
<p>
    Now to you&mdash;Ba! When I go through sweetness to sweetness, at 'Ba' I
    stop last of all, and lie and rest. That is the quintessence of them
    all,&mdash;they all take colour and flavour from that. So, dear, dear Ba,
    be glad as you can to see me to-morrow. God knows how I embalm every
    such day,&mdash;I do not believe that one of the <i>forty</i> is confounded with
    another in my memory. So, <i>that</i> is gained and sure for ever. And of
    letters, this makes my 104th and, like Donne's Bride,
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I take,<br>
My jewels from their boxes; call<br>
My Diamonds, Pearls, and Emeralds, and make<br>
Myself a constellation of them all!
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">Bless you, my own Beloved!
</p>
<p>
    I am much better to-day&mdash;having been not so well yesterday&mdash;whence the
    note to you, perhaps! I put that to your charity for construction. By
    the way, let the foolish and needless story about my whilome friend be
    of this use, that it records one of the traits in that same generous
    love, of me, I once mentioned, I remember&mdash;one of the points in his
    character which, I told you, <i>would</i> account, if you heard them, for
    my parting company with a good deal of warmth of attachment to myself.
</p>
<p>
    What a day! But you do not so much care for rain, I think. My Mother
    is no worse, but still suffering sadly.

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 22, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ever since I ceased to be with you&mdash;ever dearest,&mdash;have been with your
    'Luria,' if <i>that</i> is ceasing to be with you&mdash;which it <i>is</i>, I feel at
    last. Yet the new act is powerful and subtle, and very affecting, it
    seems to me, after a grave, suggested pathos; the reasoning is done on
    every hand with admirable directness and adroitness, and poor Luria's
    iron baptism under such a bright crossing of swords, most miserably
    complete. Still ... is he to die <i>so</i>? can you mean it? Oh&mdash;indeed I
    foresaw <i>that</i>&mdash;not a guess of mine ever touched such an end&mdash;and I
    can scarcely resign myself to it as a necessity, even now ... I mean,
    to the act, as Luria's act, whether it is final or not&mdash;the act of
    suicide being so unheroical. But you are a dramatic poet and right
    perhaps, where, as a didactic poet, you would have been wrong, ...
    and, after the first shock, I begin to see that your Luria is the man
    Luria and that his 'sun' lights him so far and not farther than so,
    and to understand the natural reaction of all that generous trust and
    hopefulness, what naturally it would be. Also, it is satisfactory that
    Domizia, having put her woman's part off to the last, should be too
    late with it&mdash;it will be a righteous retribution. I had fancied that
    her object was to isolate him, ... to make his military glory and
    national recompense ring hollowly to his ears, and so commend herself,
    drawing back the veil.
</p>
<p>
    Puccio's scornful working out of the low work, is very finely given,
    I think, ... and you have 'a cunning right hand,' to lift up Luria
    higher in the mind of your readers, by the very means used to pull
    down his fortunes&mdash;you show what a man he is by the very talk of his
    rivals ... by his 'natural godship' over Puccio. Then Husain is nobly
    characteristic&mdash;I like those streaks of Moorish fire in his speeches.
    'Why 'twas all fighting' &amp;c. ... <i>that</i> passage perhaps is over-subtle
    for a Husain&mdash;but too nobly right in the abstract to be altered, if it
    is so or not. Domizia talks philosophically besides, and how
    eloquently;&mdash;and very noble she is where she proclaims
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">The angel in thee and rejects the sprites<br>
That ineffectual crowd about his strength,<br>
And mingle with his work and claim a share!&mdash;
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">But why not 'spirits' rather than 'sprites,' which has a different
    association by custom? 'Spirits' is quite short enough, it seems to
    me, for a last word&mdash;it sounds like a monosyllable that trembles&mdash;or
    thrills, rather. And, do you know, I agree with yourself a little when
    you say (as did you <i>not</i> say?) that some of the speeches&mdash;Domizia's
    for instance&mdash;are too lengthy. I think I should like them to coil up
    their strength, here and there, in a few passages. Luria ... poor
    Luria ... is great and pathetic when he stands alone at last, and 'all
    his waves have gone over him.' Poor Luria!&mdash;And now, I wonder where
    Mr. Chorley will look, in this work,&mdash;along all the edges of the
    hills,&mdash;to find, or prove, his favourite 'mist!' On the glass of his
    own opera-lorgnon, perhaps:&mdash;shall we ask him to try <i>that</i>?
</p>
<p>
    But first, I want to ask <i>you</i> something&mdash;I have had it in my head a
    long time, but it might as well have been in a box&mdash;and indeed if it
    had been in the box with your letters, I should have remembered to
    speak of it long ago. So now, at last, tell me&mdash;how do you write, O my
    poet? with steel pens, or Bramah pens, or goose-quills or
    crow-quills?&mdash;Because I have a penholder which was given to me when I
    was a child, and which I have used both then and since in the
    production of various great epics and immortal 'works,' until in these
    latter years it has seemed to me too heavy, and I have taken into
    service, instead of it, another two-inch-long instrument which makes
    Mr. Kenyon laugh to look at&mdash;and so, my fancy has run upon your having
    the heavier holder, which is not very heavy after all, and which will
    make you think of me whether you choose it or not, besides being made
    of a splinter from the ivory gate of old, and therefore not unworthy
    of a true prophet. Will you have it, dearest? Yes&mdash;because you can't
    help it. When you come ... on Saturday!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And for 'Pauline,' ... I am satisfied with the promise to see it some
    day ... when we are in the isle of the sirens, or ready for wandering
    in the Doges' galleries. I seem to understand that you would really
    rather wish me not to see it now ... and as long as I <i>do</i> see it! So
    <i>that shall</i> be!&mdash;Am I not good now, and not a teazer? If there is any
    poetical justice in 'the seven worlds,' I shall have a letter
    to-night.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, you owe me two letters by your confession. A hundred and
    four of mine you have, and I, only a hundred and two of yours ...
    which is a 'deficit' scarcely creditable to me, (now is it?) when,
    according to the law and ordinance, a woman's hundred and four letters
    would take two hundred and eight at least, from the other side, to
    justify them. Well&mdash;I feel inclined to wring out the legal per centage
    to the uttermost farthing; but fall into a fit of gratitude,
    notwithstanding, thinking of Monday, and how the second letter came
    beyond hope. Always better, you are, than I guess you to be,&mdash;and it
    was being <i>best</i>, to write, as you did, for me to hear twice on one
    day!&mdash;best and dearest!
</p>
<p>
    But the first letter was not what you feared&mdash;I know you too well not
    to know how that letter was written and with what intention. <i>Do
    you</i>, on the other hand, endeavour to comprehend how there may be an
    eccentricity and obliquity in certain relations and on certain
    subjects, while the general character stands up worthily of esteem and
    regard&mdash;even of yours. Mr. Kenyon says broadly that it is
    monomania&mdash;neither more nor less. Then the principle of passive filial
    obedience is held&mdash;drawn (and quartered) from Scripture. He <i>sees</i> the
    law and the gospel on his side. Only the other day, there was a
    setting forth of the whole doctrine, I hear, down-stairs&mdash;'passive
    obedience, and particularly in respect to marriage.' One after the
    other, my brothers all walked out of the room, and there was left for
    sole auditor, Captain Surtees Cook, who had especial reasons for
    sitting it out against his will,&mdash;so he sate and asked 'if children
    were to be considered slaves' as meekly as if he were asking for
    information. I could not help smiling when I heard of it. He is just
    <i>succeeding</i> in obtaining what is called an 'adjutancy,' which, with
    the half pay, will put an end to many anxieties.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest&mdash;when, in the next dream, you meet me in the 'landing-place,'
    tell me why I am to stand up to be reviewed again. What a fancy,
    <i>that</i> is of yours, for 'full-lengths'&mdash;and what bad policy, if a
    fancy, to talk of it so! because you would have had the glory and
    advantage, and privilege, of seeing me on my feet twenty times before
    now, if you had not impressed on me, in some ineffable manner, that to
    stand on my head would scarcely be stranger. Nevertheless you shall
    have it your own way, as you have everything&mdash;which makes you so very,
    very, exemplarily submissive, you know!
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon does not come&mdash;puts it off to <i>Saturday</i> perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Daily News</i> I have had a glance at. A weak leading article, I
    thought ... and nothing stronger from Ireland:&mdash;but enough
    advertisements to promise a long future. What do you think? or have
    you not seen the paper? No broad principles laid down. A mere
    newspaper-support of the 'League.'
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. Say how you are&mdash;and <i>do</i> walk, and 'care' for
    yourself,
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">and, so, for your own</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Ba</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Have I expressed to you at all how 'Luria' impresses <i>me</i> more and
    more? You shall see the 'remarks' with the other papers&mdash;the details
    of what strikes me.

</p>
<p>
    But you did <i>not</i> get the letter last evening&mdash;no, for all my good
    intentions&mdash;because somebody came over in the morning and forced me to
    go out ... and, perhaps, I <i>knew</i> what was coming, and had all my
    thoughts <i>there</i>, that is, <i>here</i> now, with my own letters from you. I
    think so&mdash;for this punishment, I will tell you, came for some sin or
    other last night. I woke&mdash;late, or early&mdash;and, in one of those lucid
    moments when all things are thoroughly <i>perceived</i>,&mdash;whether suggested
    by some forgotten passage in the past sleep itself, I don't know&mdash;but
    I seem to <i>apprehend</i>, comprehend entirely, for the first time, what
    would happen if I lost you&mdash;the whole sense of that <i>closed door</i> of
    Catarina's came on me at once, and it was <i>I</i> who said&mdash;not as quoting
    or adapting another's words, but spontaneously, unavoidably, '<i>In that
    door, you will not enter, I have</i>'.... And, dearest, the
</p>
<p>
    Unwritten it must remain.
</p>
<p>
    What is on the other leaf, no ill-omen, after all,&mdash;because I
    strengthened myself against a merely imaginary evil&mdash;as I do always;
    and <i>thus</i>&mdash;I know I never can lose you,&mdash;you surely are more mine,
    there is less for the future to give or take away than in the
    ordinary cases, where so much less is known, explained, possessed, as
    with us. Understand for me, my dearest&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And do you think, sweet, that there <i>is</i> any free movement of my soul
    which your penholder is to secure? Well, try,&mdash;it will be yours by
    every right of discovery&mdash;and I, for my part, will religiously report
    to you the first time I think of you 'which, but for your present I
    should not have done'&mdash;or is it not a happy, most happy way of
    ensuring a better fifth act to Luria than the foregoing? See the
    absurdity I write&mdash;when it will be more probably the ruin of the
    whole&mdash;for was it not observed in the case of a friend of mine once,
    who wrote his own part in a piece for private theatricals, and had
    ends of his own to serve in it,&mdash;that he set to work somewhat after
    this fashion: 'Scene 1st. A breakfast chamber&mdash;Lord and Lady A. at
    table&mdash;Lady A./ No more coffee my dear?&mdash;Lord A./ One more cup!
    (<i>Embracing her</i>). Lady A./ I was thinking of trying the ponies in the
    Park&mdash;are you engaged? Lord A./ Why, there's that bore of a Committee
    at the House till 2. (<i>Kissing her hand</i>).' And so forth, to the
    astonishment of the auditory, who did not exactly see the 'sequitur'
    in either instance. Well, dearest, whatever comes of it, the 'aside,'
    the bye-play, the digression, will be the best, and only true business
    of the piece. And though I must smile at your notion of securing
    <i>that</i> by any fresh appliance, mechanical or spiritual, yet I do thank
    you, dearest, thank you from my heart indeed&mdash;(and I write with
    Bramahs <i>always</i>&mdash;not being able to make a pen!)
</p>
<p>
    If you have gone so far with 'Luria,' I fancy myself nearly or
    altogether safe. I must not tell you, but I wished just these feelings
    to be in your mind about Domizia, and the death of Luria: the last act
    throws light back on all, I hope. Observe only, that Luria <i>would</i>
    stand, if I have plied him effectually with adverse influences, in
    such a position as to render any other end impossible without the hurt
    to Florence which his religion is, to avoid inflicting&mdash;passively
    awaiting, for instance, the sentence and punishment to come at night,
    would as surely inflict it as taking part with her foes. His aim is to
    prevent the harm she will do herself by striking him, so he moves
    aside from the blow. But I know there is very much to improve and
    heighten in this fourth act, as in the others&mdash;but the right aspect of
    things seems obtained and the rest of the work is plain and easy.
</p>
<p>
    I am obliged to leave off&mdash;the rest to-morrow&mdash;and then dear,
    Saturday! I love you utterly, my own best, dearest&mdash;

</p>
<p>
    Yes, I understand your 'Luria'&mdash;and there is to be more light; and I
    open the window to the east and wait for it&mdash;a little less gladly than
    for <i>you</i> on Saturday, dearest. In the meanwhile you have 'lucid
    moments,' and 'strengthen' yourself into the wisdom of learning to
    love me&mdash;and, upon consideration, it does not seem to be so hard after
    all ... there is 'less for the future to take away' than you had
    supposed&mdash;so <i>that</i> is the way? Ah, 'these lucid moments, in which all
    things are thoroughly <i>perceived</i>';&mdash;what harm they do me!&mdash;And I am
    to 'understand for you,' you say!&mdash;Am I?
</p>
<p>
    On the other side, and to make the good omen complete, I remembered,
    after I had sealed my last letter, having made a confusion between the
    ivory and horn gates, the gates of false and true visions, as I am apt
    to do&mdash;and my penholder belongs to the ivory gate, ... as you will
    perceive in your lucid moments&mdash;poor holder! But, as you forget me on
    Wednesdays, the post testifying, ... the sinecure may not be quite so
    certain as the Thursday's letter says. And <i>I</i> too, in the meanwhile,
    grow wiser, ... having learnt something which you cannot do,&mdash;you of
    the 'Bells and Pomegranates': <i>You cannot make a pen.</i> Yesterday I
    looked round the world in vain for it.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon does not come&mdash;<i>will</i> not perhaps until Saturday! Which
    reminds me&mdash;Mr. Kenyon told me about a year ago that he had been
    painfully employed that morning in <i>parting</i> two&mdash;dearer than
    friends&mdash;and he had done it he said, by proving to either, that he or
    she was likely to mar the prospects of the other. 'If I had spoken to
    each, of himself or herself,' he said, 'I <i>never could have done it</i>.'
</p>
<p>
    Was not <i>that</i> an ingenious cruelty? The remembrance rose up in me
    like a ghost, and made me ask you once to promise what you promised
    ... (you recollect?) because I could not bear to be stabbed with my
    own dagger by the hand of a third person ... <i>so</i>! When people have
    lucid moments themselves, you know, it is different.
</p>
<p>
    And <i>shall</i> I indeed have a letter to-morrow? Or, not having the
    penholder yet, will you....

    Now, of all perverse interpretations that ever were and never ought to
    have been, commend me to this of Ba's&mdash;after I bade her generosity
    'understand me,' too!&mdash;which meant, 'let her pick out of my disjointed
    sentences a general meaning, if she can,&mdash;which I very well know their
    imperfect utterance would not give to one unsupplied with the key of
    my whole heart's-mystery'&mdash;and Ba, with the key in her hand, to
    pretend and poke feathers and penholders into the key-hole, and
    complain that the wards are wrong! So&mdash;when the poor scholar, one has
    read of, uses not very dissimilar language and argument&mdash;who being
    threatened with the deprivation of his Virgil learnt the Æneid by
    heart and then said 'Take what you can now'!&mdash;<i>that</i> Ba calls
    'feeling the loss would not be so hard after all'!&mdash;<i>I</i> do not, at
    least. And if at any future moment I should again be visited&mdash;as I
    earnestly desire may never be the case&mdash;with a sudden consciousness of
    the entire inutility of all earthly love (since of <i>my</i> love) to hold
    its object back from the decree of God, if such should call it away;
    one of those known facts which, for practical good, we treat as
    supremely common-place, but which, like those of the uncertainty of
    life&mdash;the very existence of God, I may say&mdash;if they were <i>not</i>
    common-place, and could they be thoroughly apprehended (except in the
    chance minutes which make one grow old, not the mere years)&mdash;the
    business of the world would cease; but when you find Chaucer's graver
    at his work of 'graving smale seles' by the sun's light, you know that
    the sun's self could not have been <i>created</i> on that day&mdash;do you
    'understand' that, Ba? And when I am with you, or here or writing or
    walking&mdash;and perfectly happy in the sunshine of you, I very well know
    I am no wiser than is good for me and that there seems no harm in
    feeling it impossible this should change, or fail to go on increasing
    till this world ends and we are safe, I with you, for ever. But
    when&mdash;if only <i>once</i>, as I told you, recording it for its very
    strangeness, I <i>do</i> feel&mdash;in a flash&mdash;that words are words, and could
    not alter <i>that</i> decree ... will you tell me how, after all, that
    conviction and the true woe of it are better met than by the as
    thorough conviction that, for one blessing, the extreme woe is
    <i>impossible</i> now&mdash;that you <i>are</i>, and have been, <i>mine</i>, and <i>me</i>&mdash;one
    with me, never to be parted&mdash;so that the complete separation not being
    to be thought of, such an incomplete one as is yet in Fate's power may
    be the less likely to attract her notice? And, dearest, in all
    emergencies, see, I go to you for help; for your gift of better
    comfort than is found in myself. Or ought I, if I could, to add one
    more proof to the Greek proverb 'that the half is greater than the
    whole'&mdash;and only love you for myself (it is absurd; but if I <i>could</i>
    disentwine you from my soul in that sense), only see my own will, and
    good (not in <i>your</i> will and good, as I now see them and shall ever
    see) ... should you say I <i>did</i> love you then? Perhaps. And it would
    have been better for me, I know&mdash;I should not have <i>written</i> this or
    the like&mdash;there being no post in the Siren's isle, as you will see.
</p>
<p>
    And the end of the whole matter is&mdash;what? Not by any means what my Ba
    expects or ought to expect; that I say with a flounce 'Catch me
    blotting down on paper, again, the first vague impressions in the
    weakest words and being sure I have only to bid her
    "understand"!&mdash;when I can get "Blair on Rhetoric," and the additional
    chapter on the proper conduct of a letter'! On the contrary I tell
    you, Ba, my own heart's dearest, I will provoke you tenfold worse;
    will tell you all that comes uppermost, and what frightens me or
    reassures me, in moments lucid or opaque&mdash;and when all the pen-stumps
    and holders refuse to open the lock, out will come the key perforce;
    and once put that knowledge&mdash;of the entire love and worship of my
    heart and soul&mdash;to its proper use, and all will be clear&mdash;tell me
    to-morrow that it will be clear when I call you to account and exact
    strict payment for every word and phrase and full-stop and partial
    stop, and no stop at all, in this wicked little note which got so
    treacherously the kisses and the thankfulness&mdash;written with no
    penholder that is to belong to me, I hope&mdash;but with the feather,
    possibly, which Sycorax wiped the dew from, as Caliban remembered when
    he was angry! All but&mdash;(that is, all was wrong but)&mdash;to be just ...
    the old, dear, so dear ending which makes my heart beat now as at
    first ... and so, pays for all! Wherefore, all is right again, is it
    not? and you are my own priceless Ba, my very own&mdash;and I will have
    you, if you like that style, and want you, and must have you every day
    and all day long&mdash;much less see you to-morrow <i>stand</i>&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    ... Now, there breaks down my new spirit&mdash;and, shame or no, I must
    pray you, in the old way, <i>not</i> to <i>receive me standing</i>&mdash;I should not
    remain master of myself I do believe!
</p>
<p>
    You have put out of my head all I intended to write&mdash;and now I slowly
    begin to remember the matters they seem strangely unimportant&mdash;that
    poor impotency of a Newspaper! No&mdash;nothing of that for the present.
    To-morrow my dearest! Ba's first comment&mdash;'<i>To-morrow?</i> <i>To-day</i> is
    too soon, it seems&mdash;yet it is wise, perhaps, to avoid the satiety &amp;c.
    &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.'
</p>
<p>
    Does she feel how I kissed that comment back on her dear self as fit
    punishment?

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, January 26, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    I must begin by invoking my own stupidity! To forget after all the
    penholder! I had put it close beside me too on the table, and never
    once thought of it afterwards from first to last&mdash;just as I should do
    if I had a common-place book, the memoranda all turning to
    obliviscenda as by particular contact. So I shall send the holder with
    Miss Martineau's books which you can read or not as you like ... they
    have beauty in passages ... but, trained up against the wall of a set
    design, want room for branching and blossoming, great as her skill is.
    I like her 'Playfellow' stories twice as well. Do you know <i>them</i>?
    Written for children, and in such a fine heroic child-spirit as to be
    too young and too old for nobody. Oh, and I send you besides a most
    frightful extract from an American magazine sent to me yesterday ...
    no, the day before ... on the subject of mesmerism&mdash;and you are to
    understand, if you please, that the Mr. Edgar Poe who stands committed
    in it, is my dedicator ... whose dedication I forgot, by the way, with
    the rest&mdash;so, while I am sending, you shall have his poems with his
    mesmeric experience and decide whether the outrageous compliment to
    E.B.B. or the experiment on M. Vandeleur [Valdemar] goes furthest to
    prove him mad. There is poetry in the man, though, now and then, seen
    between the great gaps of bathos.... 'Politian' will make you
    laugh&mdash;as the 'Raven' made <i>me</i> laugh, though with something in it
    which accounts for the hold it took upon people such as Mr. N.P.
    Willis and his peers&mdash;it was sent to me from <i>four</i> different quarters
    besides the author himself, before its publication in this form, and
    when it had only a newspaper life. Some of the other lyrics have power
    of a less questionable sort. For the author, I do not know him at
    all&mdash;never heard from him nor wrote to him&mdash;and in my opinion, there
    is more faculty shown in the account of that horrible mesmeric
    experience (mad or not mad) than in his poems. Now do read it from the
    beginning to the end. That '<i>going out</i>' of the hectic, struck me very
    much ... and the writhing <i>away</i> of the upper lip. Most
    horrible!&mdash;Then I believe so much of mesmerism, as to give room for
    the full acting of the story on me ... without absolutely giving full
    credence to it, understand.
</p>
<p>
    Ever dearest, you could not think me in earnest in that letter? It was
    because I understood you so perfectly that I felt at liberty for the
    jesting a little&mdash;for had I not thought of <i>that</i> before, myself, and
    was I not reproved for speaking of it, when I said that I was content,
    for my part, even <i>so</i>? Surely you remember&mdash;and I should not have
    said it if I had not felt with you, felt and known, that 'there is,
    with us, less for the future to give or take away than in the ordinary
    cases.' So much less! All the happiness I have known has come to me
    through you, and it is enough to live for or die in&mdash;therefore living
    or dying I would thank God, and use that word '<i>enough</i>' ... being
    yours in life and death. And always understanding that if either of us
    should go, you must let it be this one here who was nearly gone when
    she knew you, since I could not bear&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Now see if it is possible to write on this subject, unless one laughs
    to stop the tears. I was more wise on Friday.
</p>
<p>
    Let me tell you instead of my sister's affairs, which are so publicly
    talked of in this house that there is no confidence to be broken in
    respect to them&mdash;yet my brothers only see and hear, and are told
    nothing, to keep them as clear as possible from responsibility. I may
    say of Henrietta that her only fault is, her virtues being written in
    water&mdash;I know not of one other fault. She has too much softness to be
    able to say 'no' in the right place&mdash;and thus, without the slightest
    levity ... perfectly blameless in that respect, ... she says half a
    yes or a quarter of a yes, or a yes in some sort of form, too
    often&mdash;but I will tell you. Two years ago, three men were loving her,
    as they called it. After a few months, and the proper quantity of
    interpretations, one of them consoled himself by giving nick-names to
    his rivals. Perseverance and Despair he called them, and so, went up
    to the boxes to see out the rest of the play. Despair ran to a crisis,
    was rejected in so many words, but appealed against the judgment and
    had his claim admitted&mdash;it was all silence and mildness on each side
    ... a tacit gaining of ground,&mdash;Despair 'was at least a gentleman,'
    said my brothers. On which Perseverance came on with violent
    re-iterations,&mdash;insisted that she loved him without knowing it, or
    <i>should</i>&mdash;elbowed poor Despair into the open streets, who being a
    gentleman wouldn't elbow again&mdash;swore that 'if she married another he
    would wait till she became a widow, trusting to Providence' ... <i>did</i>
    wait every morning till the head of the house was out, and sate day by
    day, in spite of the disinclination of my sisters and the rudeness of
    all my brothers, four hours in the drawing-room ... let himself be
    refused once a week and sate all the longer ... allowed everybody in
    the house (and a few visitors) to see and hear him in fits of
    hysterical sobbing, and sate on unabashed, the end being that he sits
    now sole regnant, my poor sister saying softly, with a few tears of
    remorse for her own instability, that she is 'taken by storm and
    cannot help it.' I give you only the <i>résumé</i> of this military
    movement&mdash;and though I seem to smile, which it was impossible to avoid
    at some points of the evidence as I heard it from first one person and
    then another, yet I am woman enough rather to be glad that the
    decision is made <i>so</i>. He is sincerely attached to her, I believe; and
    the want of refinement and sensibility (for he understood her
    affections to be engaged to another at one time) is covered in a
    measure by the earnestness,&mdash;and justified too by the event&mdash;everybody
    being quite happy and contented, even to Despair, who has a new horse
    and takes lessons in music.
</p>
<p>
    That's love&mdash;is it not? And that's my answer (if you look for it) to
    the question you asked me yesterday.
</p>
<p>
    Yet do not think that I am turning it all to game. I could not do so
    with any real earnest sentiment ... I never could ... and now least,
    and with my own sister whom I love so. One may smile to oneself and
    yet wish another well&mdash;and so I smile to <i>you</i>&mdash;and it is all safe
    with you I know. He is a second or third cousin of ours and has golden
    opinions from all his friends and fellow-officers&mdash;and for the rest,
    most of these men are like one another.... I never could see the
    difference between fuller's earth and common clay, among them all.
</p>
<p>
    What do you think he has said since&mdash;to <i>her</i> too?&mdash;'I always
    persevere about everything. Once I began to write a farce&mdash;which they
    told me was as bad as could be. Well!&mdash;I persevered!&mdash;<i>I finished
    it</i>.' Perfectly unconscious, both he and she were of there being
    anything mal à propos in <i>that</i>&mdash;and no kind of harm was meant,&mdash;only
    it expresses the man.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest&mdash;it had better be Thursday I think&mdash;<i>our</i> day! I was showing
    to-day your father's drawings,&mdash;and my brothers, and Arabel besides,
    admired them very much on the right grounds. Say how you are. You did
    not seem to me to answer frankly this time, and I was more than half
    uneasy when you went away. Take exercise, dear, dearest ... think of
    me enough for it,&mdash;and do not hurry 'Luria.' May God bless you!

<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, January 26, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    I will not try and write much to-night, dearest, for my head gives a
    little warning&mdash;and I have so much to think of!&mdash;spite of my penholder
    being kept back from me after all! Now, ought I to have asked for it?
    Or did I not seem grateful enough at the promise? This last would be a
    characteristic reason, seeing that I reproached myself with feeling
    <i>too</i> grateful for the 'special symbol'&mdash;the 'essential meaning' of
    which was already in my soul. Well then, I will&mdash;I do pray for
    it&mdash;next time; and I will keep it for that one yesterday and all its
    memories&mdash;and it shall bear witness against me, if, on the Siren's
    isle, I grow forgetful of Wimpole Street. And when is 'next time' to
    be&mdash;Wednesday or Thursday? When I look back on the strangely steady
    widening of my horizon&mdash;how no least interruption has occurred to
    visits or letters&mdash;oh, care <i>you</i>, sweet&mdash;care for us both!
</p>
<p>
    That remark of your sister's delights me&mdash;you remember?&mdash;that the
    anger would not be so formidable. I have exactly the fear of
    encountering <i>that</i>, which the sense of having to deal with a ghost
    would induce: there's no striking at it with one's partizan. Well, God
    is above all! It is not my fault if it so happens that by returning my
    love you make me exquisitely blessed; I believe&mdash;more than hope, I am
    <i>sure</i> I should do all I ever <i>now</i> can do, if you were never to know
    it&mdash;that is, my love for you was in the first instance its own
    reward&mdash;if one must use such phrases&mdash;and if it were possible for
    that ... not <i>anger</i>, which is of no good, but that <i>opposition</i>&mdash;that
    adverse will&mdash;to show that your good would be attained by the&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But it would need to be <i>shown</i> to me. You have said thus to me&mdash;in
    the very last letter, indeed. But with me, or any <i>man</i>, the instincts
    of happiness develop themselves too unmistakably where there is
    anything like a freedom of will. The man whose heart is set on being
    rich or influential after the worldly fashion, may be found far enough
    from the attainment of either riches or influence&mdash;but he will be in
    the presumed way to them&mdash;pumping at the pump, if he is really anxious
    for water, even though the pump be dry&mdash;but not sitting still by the
    dusty roadside.
</p>
<p>
    I believe&mdash;first of all, you&mdash;but when that is done, and I am allowed
    to call your heart <i>mine</i>,&mdash;I cannot think you would be happy if
    parted from me&mdash;and <i>that</i> belief, coming to add to my own feeling in
    <i>that</i> case. So, this will <i>be</i>&mdash;I trust in God.
</p>
<p>
    In life, in death, I am your own, <i>my</i> own! My head has got well
    already! It is so slight a thing, that I make such an ado about! Do
    not reply to these bodings&mdash;they are gone&mdash;they seem absurd! All steps
    secured but the last, and that last the easiest! Yes&mdash;far easiest! For
    first you had to be created, only that; and then, in my time; and
    then, not in Timbuctoo but Wimpole Street, and then ... the strange
    hedge round the sleeping Palace keeping the world off&mdash;and then ...
    all was to begin, all the difficulty only <i>begin</i>:&mdash;and now ... see
    where is reached! And I kiss you, and bless you, my dearest, in
    earnest of the end!

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Monday.<br>
[Post-mark, January 27, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You have had my letter and heard about the penholder. Your fancy of
    'not seeming grateful enough,' is not wise enough for <i>you</i>, dearest;
    when you know that <i>I</i> know your common fault to be the undue
    magnifying of everything that comes from me, and I am always
    complaining of it outwardly and inwardly. That suddenly I should set
    about desiring you to be more grateful,&mdash;even for so great a boon as
    an old penholder,&mdash;would be a more astounding change than any to be
    sought or seen in a prime minister.
</p>
<p>
    Another mistake you made concerning Henrietta and her opinion&mdash;and
    there's no use nor comfort in leaving you in it. Henrietta says that
    the 'anger would not be so formidable after all'! Poor dearest
    Henrietta, who trembles at the least bending of the brows ... who has
    less courage than I, and the same views of the future! What she
    referred to, was simply the infrequency of the visits. 'Why was I
    afraid,' she said&mdash;'where was the danger? who would be the
    <i>informer</i>?'&mdash;Well! I will not say any more. It is just natural that
    you, in your circumstances and associations, should be unable to see
    what I have seen from the beginning&mdash;only you will not hereafter
    reproach me, in the most secret of your thoughts, for not having told
    you plainly. If I could have told you with greater plainness I should
    blame myself (and I do not) because it is not an opinion I have, but a
    perception. I see, I know. The result ... the end of all ... perhaps
    now and then I see <i>that</i> too ... in the 'lucid moments' which are not
    the happiest for anybody. Remember, in all cases, that I shall not
    repent of any part of our past intercourse; and that, therefore, when
    the time for decision comes, you will be free to look at the question
    as if you saw it then for the first moment, without being hampered by
    considerations about 'all those yesterdays.'
</p>
<p>
    For <i>him</i> ... he would rather see me dead at his foot than yield the
    point: and he will say so, and mean it, and persist in the meaning.
</p>
<p>
    Do you ever wonder at me ... that I should write such things, and have
    written others so different? <i>I have thought that in myself very
    often.</i> Insincerity and injustice may seem the two ends, while I
    occupy the straight betwixt two&mdash;and I should not like you to doubt
    how this may be! Sometimes I have begun to show you the truth, and
    torn the paper; I <i>could</i> not. Yet now again I am borne on to tell
    you, ... to save you from some thoughts which you cannot help perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    There has been no insincerity&mdash;nor is there injustice. I believe, I am
    certain, I have loved him better than the rest of his children. I have
    heard the fountain within the rock, and my heart has struggled in
    towards him through the stones of the rock ... thrust off ... dropping
    off ... turning in again and clinging! Knowing what is excellent in
    him well, loving him as my only parent left, and for himself dearly,
    notwithstanding that hardness and the miserable 'system' which made
    him appear harder still, I have loved him and been proud of him for
    his high qualities, for his courage and fortitude when he bore up so
    bravely years ago under the worldly reverses which he yet felt
    acutely&mdash;more than you and I could feel them&mdash;but the fortitude was
    admirable. Then came the trials of love&mdash;then, I was repulsed too
    often, ... made to suffer in the suffering of those by my side ...
    depressed by petty daily sadnesses and terrors, from which it is
    possible however for an elastic affection to rise again as past. Yet
    my friends used to say 'You look broken-spirited'&mdash;and it was true. In
    the midst, came my illness,&mdash;and when I was ill he grew gentler and
    let me draw nearer than ever I had done: and after that great stroke
    ... you <i>know</i> ... though <i>that</i> fell in the middle of a storm of
    emotion and sympathy on my part, which drove clearly against him, God
    seemed to strike our hearts together by the shock; and I was grateful
    to him for not saying aloud what I said to myself in my agony, '<i>If it
    had not been for you</i>'...! And comparing my self-reproach to what I
    imagined his self-reproach must certainly be (for if <i>I</i> had loved
    selfishly, <i>he</i> had not been kind), I felt as if I could love and
    forgive him for two ... (I knowing that serene generous departed
    spirit, and seeming left to represent it) ... and I did love him
    better than all those left to <i>me</i> to love in the world here. I proved
    a little my affection for him, by coming to London at the risk of my
    life rather than diminish the comfort of his home by keeping a part of
    my family away from him. And afterwards for long and long he spoke to
    me kindly and gently, and of me affectionately and with too much
    praise; and God knows that I had as much joy as I imagined myself
    capable of again, in the sound of his footstep on the stairs, and of
    his voice when he prayed in this room; my best hope, as I have told
    him since, being, to die beneath his eyes. Love is so much to me
    naturally&mdash;it is, to all women! and it was so much to <i>me</i> to feel
    sure at last that <i>he</i> loved me&mdash;to forget all blame&mdash;to pull the
    weeds up from that last illusion of life:&mdash;and this, till the
    Pisa-business, which threw me off, far as ever, again&mdash;farther than
    ever&mdash;when George said 'he could not flatter me' and I dared not
    flatter myself. But do <i>you</i> believe that I never wrote what I did not
    feel: I never did. And I ask one kindness more ... do not notice what
    I have written here. Let it pass. We can alter nothing by ever so many
    words. After all, he is the victim. He isolates himself&mdash;and now and
    then he feels it ... the cold dead silence all round, which is the
    effect of an incredible system. If he were not stronger than most men,
    he could not bear it as he does. With such high qualities too!&mdash;so
    upright and honourable&mdash;you would esteem him, you would like him, I
    think. And so ... dearest ... let <i>that</i> be the last word.
</p>
<p>
    I dare say you have asked yourself sometimes, why it was that I never
    managed to draw you into the house here, so that you might make your
    own way. Now <i>that</i> is one of the things impossible to me. I have not
    influence enough for <i>that</i>. George can never invite a friend of his
    even. Do you see? The people who do come here, come by particular
    license and association ... Capt. Surtees Cook being one of them.
    Once ... when I was in high favour too ... I asked for Mr. Kenyon to
    be invited to dinner&mdash;he an old college friend, and living close by
    and so affectionate to me always&mdash;I felt that he must be hurt by the
    neglect, and asked. <i>It was in vain.</i> Now, you see&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you always! I wrote all my spirits away in this letter
    yesterday, and kept it to finish to-day ... being yours every day,
    glad or sad, ever beloved!&mdash;

<p>
    Why will you give me such unnecessary proofs of your goodness? Why not
    leave the books for me to take away, at all events? No&mdash;you must fold
    up, and tie round, and seal over, and be at all the pains in the world
    with those hands I see now. But you only threaten; say you 'shall
    send'&mdash;as yet, and nothing having come, I do pray you, if not too
    late, to save me the shame&mdash;add to the gratitude you never can now, I
    think ... only <i>think</i>, for you are a siren, and I don't know
    certainly to what your magic may not extend. Thus, in not so important
    a matter, I should have said, the day before yesterday, that no letter
    from you could make my heart rise within me, more than of old ...
    unless it should happen to be of twice the ordinary thickness ... and
    <i>then</i> there's a fear at first lest the over-running of my dealt-out
    measure should be just a note of Mr. Kenyon's, for instance! But
    yesterday the very seal began with 'Ba'&mdash;Now, always seal with that
    seal my letters, dearest! Do you recollect Donne's pretty lines about
    seals?

    How your account of the actors in the 'Love's Labour Lost' amused me!

    surely! Serjt. Talfourd says&mdash;is it not he who says it?&mdash;'All tears
    are not for sorrow.' I should incline to say, from my own feeling,
    that no tears were. They only express joy in me, or sympathy with
    joy&mdash;and so is it with you too, I should think.
</p>
<p>
    Understand that I do <i>not</i> disbelieve in Mesmerism&mdash;I only object to
    insufficient evidence being put forward as quite irrefragable. I keep
    an open sense on the subject&mdash;ready to be instructed; and should have
    refused such testimony as Miss Martineau's if it had been adduced in
    support of something I firmly believed&mdash;'non <i>tali</i> auxilio'&mdash;indeed,
    so has truth been harmed, and only so, from the beginning. So, I shall
    read what you bid me, and learn all I can.
</p>
<p>
    I am not quite so well this week&mdash;yesterday some friends came early
    and kept me at home&mdash;for which I seem to suffer a little; less,
    already, than in the morning&mdash;so I will go out and walk away the
    whirring ... which is all the mighty ailment. As for 'Luria' I have
    not looked at it since I saw you&mdash;which means, saw you in the body,
    because last night I saw you; as I wonder if you know!
</p>
<p>
    Thursday, and again I am with you&mdash;and you will forget nothing ... how
    the farewell is to be returned? Ah, my dearest, sweetest Ba; how
    entirely I love you!

<p>
    Ever dearest&mdash;I will say, as you desire, nothing on that subject&mdash;but
    this strictly for myself: you engaged me to consult my own good in the
    keeping or breaking our engagement; not <i>your</i> good as it might even
    seem to me; much less seem to another. My only good in this
    world&mdash;that against which all the world goes for nothing&mdash;is to spend
    my life with you, and be yours. You know that when I <i>claim</i> anything,
    it is really yourself in me&mdash;you <i>give</i> me a right and bid me use it,
    and I, in fact, am most obeying you when I appear most exacting on my
    own account&mdash;so, in that feeling, I dare claim, once for all, and in
    all possible cases (except that dreadful one of your becoming worse
    again ... in which case I wait till life ends with both of us), I
    claim your promise's fulfilment&mdash;say, at the summer's end: it cannot
    be for your good that this state of things should continue. We can go
    to Italy for a year or two and be happy as day and night are long. For
    me, I adore you. This is all unnecessary, I feel as I write: but you
    will think of the main fact as <i>ordained</i>, granted by God, will you
    not, dearest?&mdash;so, not to be put in doubt <i>ever again</i>&mdash;then, we can
    go quietly thinking of after matters. Till to-morrow, and ever after,
    God bless my heart's own, own Ba. All my soul follows you,
    love&mdash;encircles you&mdash;and I live in being yours.

</p>
<p>
    Let it be this way, ever dearest. If in the time of fine weather, I am
    not ill, ... <i>then</i> ... <i>not now</i> ... you shall decide, and your
    decision shall be duty and desire to me, both&mdash;I will make no
    difficulties. Remember, in the meanwhile, that I <i>have</i> decided to let
    it be as you shall choose ... <i>shall</i> choose. That I love you enough
    to give you up 'for your good,' is proof (to myself at least) that I
    love you enough for any other end:&mdash;but you thought <i>too much of me in
    the last letter</i>. Do not mistake me. I believe and trust in all your
    words&mdash;only you are generous unawares, as other men are selfish.
</p>
<p>
    More, I meant to say of this; but you moved me as usual yesterday into
    the sunshine, and then I am dazzled and cannot see clearly. Still I
    see that you love me and that I am bound to you:&mdash;and 'what more need
    I see,' you may ask; while I cannot help looking out to the future, to
    the blue ridges of the hills, to the <i>chances</i> of your being happy
    with me. Well! I am yours as <i>you</i> see ... and not yours to teaze you.
    You shall decide everything when the time comes for doing anything ...
    and from this to then, I do not, dearest, expect you to use 'the
    liberty of leaping out of the window,' unless you are sure of the
    house being on fire! Nobody shall push you out of the window&mdash;least of
    all, <i>I</i>.
</p>
<p>
    For Italy ... you are right. We should be nearer the sun, as you say,
    and further from the world, as I think&mdash;out of hearing of the great
    storm of gossiping, when 'scirocco is loose.' Even if you liked to
    live altogether abroad, coming to England at intervals, it would be no
    sacrifice for me&mdash;and whether in Italy or England, we should have
    sufficient or more than sufficient means of living, without modifying
    by a line that 'good free life' of yours which you reasonably
    praise&mdash;which, if it had been necessary to modify, <i>we must have
    parted</i>, ... because I could not have borne to see you do it; though,
    that you once offered it for my sake, I never shall forget.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon stayed half an hour, and asked, after you went, if you had
    been here long. I reproached him with what they had been doing at his
    club (the Athenæum) in blackballing Douglas Jerrold, for want of
    something better to say&mdash;and he had not heard of it. There were more
    black than white balls, and Dickens was so enraged at the repulse of
    his friend that he gave in his own resignation like a privy
    councillor.
</p>
<p>
    But the really bad news is of poor Tennyson&mdash;I forgot to tell you&mdash;I
    forget everything. He is seriously ill with an internal complaint and
    confined to his bed, as George heard from a common friend. Which does
    not prevent his writing a new poem&mdash;he has finished the second book of
    it&mdash;and it is in blank verse and a fairy tale, and called the
    'University,' the university-members being all females. If George has
    not diluted the scheme of it with some law from the Inner Temple, I
    don't know what to think&mdash;it makes me open my eyes. Now isn't the
    world too old and fond of steam, for blank verse poems, in ever so
    many books, to be written on the fairies? I hope they may cure him,
    for the best deed they can do. He is not precisely in danger,
    understand&mdash;but the complaint may <i>run</i> into danger&mdash;so the account
    went.
</p>
<p>
    And you? how are you? Mind to tell me. May God bless you. Is Monday or
    Tuesday to be <i>our</i> day? If it were not for Mr. Kenyon I should take
    courage and say Monday&mdash;but Tuesday and Saturday would do as
    well&mdash;would they not?

<p>
    It is a relief to me this time to obey your wish, and reserve further
    remark on <i>that</i> subject till by and bye. And, whereas some people, I
    suppose, have to lash themselves up to the due point of passion, and
    choose the happy minutes to be as loving in as they possibly can ...
    (that is, in <i>expression</i>; the just correspondency of word to fact and
    feeling: for <i>it</i>&mdash;the love&mdash;may be very truly <i>there</i>, at the bottom,
    when it is got at, and spoken out)&mdash;quite otherwise, I do really have
    to guard my tongue and set a watch on my pen ... that so I may say as
    little as can well be likely to be excepted to by your generosity.
    Dearest, <i>love</i> means <i>love</i>, certainly, and adoration carries its
    sense with it&mdash;and <i>so</i>, you may have received my feeling in that
    shape&mdash;but when I begin to hint at the merest putting into practice
    one or the other profession, you 'fly out'&mdash;instead of keeping your
    throne. So let this letter lie awhile, till my heart is more used to
    it, and after some days or weeks I will find as cold and quiet a
    moment as I can, and by standing as far off you as I shall be able,
    see more&mdash;'si <i>minus propè</i> stes, te capiet magis.' Meanwhile, silent
    or speaking, I am yours to dispose of as that <i>glove</i>&mdash;not that hand.
</p>
<p>
    I must think that Mr. Kenyon sees, and knows, and ... in his goodness
    ... hardly disapproves&mdash;he knows I could not avoid&mdash;escape you&mdash;for he
    knows, in a manner, what you are ... like your American; and, early in
    our intercourse, he asked me (did I tell you?) 'what I thought of his
    young relative'&mdash;and I considered half a second to this effect&mdash;'if he
    asked me what I thought of the Queen-diamond they showed me in the
    crown of the Czar&mdash;and I answered truly&mdash;he would not return; "then of
    course you mean to try and get it to keep."' So I <i>did</i> tell the truth
    in a very few words. Well, it is no matter.
</p>
<p>
    I am sorry to hear of poor Tennyson's condition. The projected
    book&mdash;title, scheme, all of it,&mdash;<i>that</i> is astounding;&mdash;and fairies?
    If 'Thorpes and barnes, sheep-pens and dairies&mdash;<i>this</i> maketh that
    there ben no fairies'&mdash;locomotives and the broad or narrow gauge must
    keep the very ghosts of them away. But how the fashion of this world
    passes; the forms its beauty and truth take; if <i>we</i> have the making
    of such! I went last night, out of pure shame at a broken promise, to
    hear Miss Cushman and her sister in 'Romeo and Juliet.' The whole play
    goes ... horribly; 'speak' bids the Poet, and so M. Walladmir
    [Valdemar] moves his tongue and dispenses with his jaws. Whatever is
    slightly touched in, indicated, to give relief to something actually
    insisted upon and drawn boldly ... <i>here</i>, you have it gone over with
    an unremitting burnt-stick, till it stares black forever! Romeo goes
    whining about Verona by broad daylight. Yet when a schoolfellow of
    mine, I remember, began translating in class Virgil after this mode,
    'Sic fatur&mdash;so said Æneas; lachrymans&mdash;<i>a-crying</i>' ... our pedagogue
    turned on him furiously&mdash;'D'ye think Æneas made such a noise&mdash;as <i>you</i>
    shall, presently?' How easy to conceive a boyish half-melancholy,
    smiling at itself.
</p>
<p>
    Then <i>Tuesday</i>, and not Monday ... and Saturday will be the nearer
    afterward. I am singularly well to-day&mdash;head quite quiet&mdash;and
    yesterday your penholder began its influence and I wrote about half my
    last act. Writing is nothing, nor praise, nor blame, nor living, nor
    dying, but you are all my true life; May God bless you ever&mdash;

</p>
<p>
    Something, you said yesterday, made me happy&mdash;'that your liking for me
    did not come and go'&mdash;do you remember? Because there was a letter,
    written at a crisis long since, in which you showed yourself awfully,
    as a burning mountain, and talked of 'making the most of your
    fire-eyes,' and of having at intervals 'deep black pits of cold
    water'!&mdash;and the lava of that letter has kept running down into my
    thoughts of you too much, until quite of late&mdash;while even yesterday I
    was not too well instructed to be 'happy,' you see! Do not reproach
    me! I would not have 'heard your enemy say so'&mdash;it was your own word!
    And the other long word <i>idiosyncrasy</i> seemed long enough to cover it;
    and it might have been a matter of temperament, I fancied, that a man
    of genius, in the mystery of his nature, should find his feelings
    sometimes like dumb notes in a piano ... should care for people at
    half past eleven on Tuesday, and on Wednesday at noon prefer a black
    beetle. How you frightened me with your 'fire-eyes'! 'making the most
    of them' too! and the 'black pits,' which gaped ... <i>where</i> did they
    gape? who could tell? Oh&mdash;but lately I have not been crossed so, of
    course, with those fabulous terrors&mdash;lately that horror of the burning
    mountain has grown more like a superstition than a rational fear!&mdash;and
    if I was glad ... happy ... yesterday, it was but as a tolerably
    sensible nervous man might be glad of a clearer moonlight, showing him
    that what he had half shuddered at for a sheeted ghoule, was only a
    white horse on the moor. Such a great white horse!&mdash;call it the
    'mammoth horse'&mdash;the '<i>real</i> mammoth,' this time!
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, did I write you a cold letter the last time? Almost it seems
    so to me! the reason being that my feelings were near to overflow, and
    that I had to hold the cup straight to prevent the possible dropping
    on your purple underneath. <i>Your</i> letter, the letter I answered, was
    in my heart ... <i>is</i> in my heart&mdash;and all the yeses in the world would
    not be too many for such a letter, as I felt and feel. Also, perhaps,
    I gave you, at last, a merely formal distinction&mdash;and it comes to the
    same thing practically without any doubt! but I shrank, with a sort of
    instinct, from appearing (to myself, mind) to take a security from
    your words now (said too on an obvious impulse) for what should,
    would, <i>must</i>, depend on your deliberate wishes hereafter. You
    understand&mdash;you will not accuse me of over-cautiousness and the like.
    On the contrary, you are all things to me, ... instead of all and
    better than all! You have fallen like a great luminous blot on the
    whole leaf of the world ... of life and time ... and I can see nothing
    beyond you, nor wish to see it. As to all that was evil and sadness to
    me, I do not feel it any longer&mdash;it may be raining still, but I am in
    the shelter and can scarcely tell. If you <i>could</i> be <i>too dear</i> to me
    you would be now&mdash;but you could not&mdash;I do not believe in those
    supposed excesses of pure affections&mdash;God cannot be too great.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore it is a conditional engagement still&mdash;all the conditions
    being in your hands, except the necessary one, of my health. And shall
    I tell you what is 'not to be put in doubt <i>ever</i>'?&mdash;your goodness,
    <i>that</i> is ... and every tie that binds me to you. 'Ordained, granted
    by God' it is, that I should owe the only happiness in my life to you,
    and be contented and grateful (if it were necessary) to stop with it
    at this present point. Still I <i>do not</i>&mdash;there seems no necessity yet.

<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.<br>
[In the same envelope with the preceding letter.]
</p>
<p>
    Well I have your letter&mdash;and I send you the postscript to my last one,
    written yesterday you observe ... and being simply a postscript in
    some parts of it, <i>so</i> far it is not for an answer. Only I deny the
    'flying out'&mdash;perhaps you may do it a little more ... in your moments
    of starry centrifugal motion.
</p>
<p>
    So you think that dear Mr. Kenyon's opinion of his 'young
    relative'&mdash;(neither young nor his relative&mdash;not very much of either!)
    is to the effect that you couldn't possibly 'escape' her&mdash;? It looks
    like the sign of the Red Dragon, put <i>so</i> ... and your burning
    mountain is not too awful for the scenery.
</p>
<p>
    Seriously ... gravely ... if it makes me three times happy that you
    should love me, yet I grow uneasy and even saddened when you say
    infatuated things such as this and this ... unless after all you mean
    a philosophical sarcasm on the worth of Czar diamonds. No&mdash;do not say
    such things! If you do, I shall end by being jealous of some ideal
    Czarina who must stand between you and me.... I shall think that it is
    not <i>I</i> whom you look at ... and <i>pour cause</i>. 'Flying out,' <i>that</i>
    would be!
</p>
<p>
    And for Mr. Kenyon, I only know that I have grown the most ungrateful
    of human beings lately, and find myself almost glad when he does not
    come, certainly uncomfortable when he does&mdash;yes, <i>really</i> I would
    rather not see him at all, and when you are not here. The sense of
    which and the sorrow for which, turn me to a hypocrite, and make me
    ask why he does not come &amp;c. ... questions which never came to my lips
    before ... till I am more and more ashamed and sorry. Will it end, I
    wonder, by my ceasing to care for any one in the world, except,
    except...? or is it not rather that I feel trodden down by either his
    too great penetration or too great unconsciousness, both being
    overwhelming things from him to me. From a similar cause I hate
    writing letters to any of my old friends&mdash;I feel as if it were the
    merest swindling to attempt to give the least account of myself to
    anybody, and when their letters come and I know that nothing very
    fatal has happened to them, scarcely I can read to an end afterwards
    through the besetting care of having to answer it all. Then I am
    ignoble enough to revenge myself on people for their stupidities ...
    which never in my life I did before nor felt the temptation to do ...
    and when they have a distaste for your poetry through want of
    understanding, I have a distaste for <i>them</i> ... cannot help it&mdash;and
    you need not say it is wrong, because I know the whole iniquity of it,
    persisting nevertheless. As for dear Mr. Kenyon&mdash;with whom we began,
    and who thinks of you as appreciatingly and admiringly as one man can
    think of another,&mdash;do not imagine that, if he <i>should</i> see anything,
    he can 'approve' of either your wisdom or my generosity, ... <i>he</i>,
    with his large organs of caution, and his habit of looking right and
    left, and round the corner a little way. Because, you know, ... if I
    should be ill <i>before</i> ... why there, is a conclusion!&mdash;but if
    <i>afterward</i> ... what? You who talk wildly of my generosity, whereas I
    only and most impotently tried to be generous, must see how both
    suppositions have their possibility. Nevertheless you are the master
    to run the latter risk. You have overcome ... to your loss
    perhaps&mdash;unless the judgment is revised. As to taking the half of my
    prison ... I could not even smile at <i>that</i> if it seemed probable ...
    I should recoil from your affection even under a shape so fatal to you
    ... dearest! No! There is a better probability before us I hope and
    believe&mdash;in spite of the <i>possibility</i> which it is impossible to deny.
    And now we leave this subject for the present.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;You are 'singularly well.' You are very seldom quite well,
    I am afraid&mdash;yet 'Luria' seems to have done no harm this time, as you
    are singularly well the day <i>after</i> so much writing. Yet do not hurry
    that last act.... I won't have it for a long while yet.
</p>
<p>
    Here I have been reading Carlyle upon Cromwell and he is very fine,
    very much himself, it seems to me, everywhere. Did Mr. Kenyon make you
    understand that I had said there was nothing in him but <i>manner</i> ... I
    thought he said so&mdash;and I am confident that he never heard such an
    opinion from me, for good or for evil, ever at all. I may have
    observed upon those vulgar attacks on account of the so-called
    <i>mannerism</i>, the obvious fact, that an individuality, carried into the
    medium, the expression, is a feature in all men of genius, as Buffon
    teaches ... 'Le style, c'est <i>l'homme</i>.' But if the <i>whole man</i> were
    style, if all Carlyleism were manner&mdash;why there would be no man, no
    Carlyle worth talking of. I wonder that Mr. Kenyon should misrepresent
    me so. Euphuisms there may be to the end of the world&mdash;affected
    parlances&mdash;just as a fop at heart may go without shoestrings to mimic
    the distractions of some great wandering soul&mdash;although <i>that</i> is a
    bad comparison, seeing that what is called Carlyle's mannerism, is not
    his dress, but his physiognomy&mdash;or more than <i>that</i> even.
</p>
<p>
    But I do not forgive him for talking here against the 'ideals of
    poets' ... opposing their ideal by a mis-called <i>reality</i>, which is
    another sort, a baser sort, of ideal after all. He sees things in
    broad blazing lights&mdash;but he does not analyse them like a
    philosopher&mdash;do you think so? Then his praise for dumb heroic action
    as opposed to speech and singing, what is <i>that</i>&mdash;when all earnest
    thought, passion, belief, and their utterances, are as much actions
    surely as the cutting off of fifty heads by one right hand. As if
    Shakespeare's actions were not greater than Cromwell's!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But I shall write no more. Once more, may God bless you.

[Post-mark, February 4, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You ought hardly,&mdash;ought you, my Ba?&mdash;to refer to <i>that</i> letter or any
    expression in it; I had&mdash;and <i>have</i>, I trust&mdash;your forgiveness for
    what I wrote, meaning to be generous or at least just, God knows.
    That, and the other like exaggerations were there to serve the purpose
    of what you properly call a <i>crisis</i>. I <i>did</i> believe,&mdash;taking an
    expression, in the note that occasioned mine, in connection with an
    excuse which came in the postscript for not seeing me on the day
    previously appointed, I did fully believe that you were about to deny
    me admittance again unless I blotted out&mdash;not merely softened
    down&mdash;the past avowal. All was wrong, foolish, but from a good notion,
    I dare to say. And then, that particular exaggeration you bring most
    painfully to my mind&mdash;<i>that</i> does not, after all, disagree with what I
    said and you repeat&mdash;does it, if you will think? I said my other
    '<i>likings</i>' (as you rightly set it down) <i>used</i> to 'come and go,' and
    that my love for you <i>did not</i>, and that is true; the first clause as
    the last of the sentence, for my sympathies are very wide and
    general,&mdash;always have been&mdash;and the natural problem has been the
    giving unity to their object, concentrating them instead of
    dispersing. I seem to have foretold, <i>foreknown</i> you in other likings
    of mine&mdash;now here ... when the liking '<i>came</i>' ... and now elsewhere
    ... when as surely the liking '<i>went</i>': and if they had stayed before
    the time would that have been a comfort to refer to? On the contrary,
    I am as little likely to be led by delusions as can be,&mdash;for Romeo
    <i>thinks</i> he loves Rosaline, and is excused on all hands&mdash;whereas I saw
    the plain truth without one mistake, and 'looked to like, if looking
    liking moved&mdash;and no more deep <i>did</i> I endart mine eye'&mdash;about which,
    first I was very sorry, and after rather proud&mdash;all which I seem to
    have told you before.&mdash;And now, when my whole heart and soul find you,
    and fall on you, and fix forever, I am to be dreadfully afraid the joy
    cannot last, seeing that
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;it is so baseless a fear that no illustration will serve! Is it gone
    now, dearest, ever-dearest?
</p>
<p>
    And as you amuse me sometimes, as now, by seeming surprised at some
    chance expression of a truth which is grown a veriest commonplace to

    had been neglected'&mdash;when he finds himself involuntarily communicating
    truths above the capacity and acquirements of his friend, and stops
    himself after this fashion&mdash;'If you look round the world, my dear
    Sir&mdash;for it <i>is</i> round!&mdash;so I will make you laugh at me, if you will,
    for <i>my</i> inordinate delight at hearing the success of your experiment
    with the opium. I never dared, nor shall dare inquire into your use of
    that&mdash;for, knowing you utterly as I do, I know you only bend to the
    most absolute necessity in taking more or less of it&mdash;so that increase
    of the quantity must mean simply increased weakness, illness&mdash;and
    diminution, diminished illness. And now there <i>is</i> diminution! Dear,
    dear Ba&mdash;you speak of my silly head and its ailments ... well, and
    what brings on the irritation? A wet day or two spent at home; and
    what ends it all directly?&mdash;just an hour's walk! So with <i>me</i>:
    now,&mdash;fancy me shut in a room for seven years ... it is&mdash;no, <i>don't</i>
    see, even in fancy, what is left of me then! But <i>you</i>, at the end;
    this is <i>all</i> the harm: I wonder ... I confirm my soul in its belief
    in perpetual miraculousness ... I bless God with my whole heart that
    it is thus with you! And so, I will not even venture to say&mdash;so
    superfluous it were, though with my most earnest, most loving breath
    (I who <i>do</i> love you more at every breath I draw; indeed, yes
    dearest,)&mdash;I <i>will not</i> bid you&mdash;that is, pray you&mdash;to persevere! You

<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, February 5, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    But I did not&mdash;dear, dearest&mdash;no indeed, I did not mean any harm about
    the letter. I wanted to show you how you had given me pleasure&mdash;and
    so,&mdash;did I give you pain? was <i>that</i> my ingenuity? Forgive my
    unhappiness in it, and let it be as if it had not been. Only I will
    just say that what made me talk about 'the thorn in the flesh' from
    that letter so long, was a sort of conviction of your having put into
    it as much of the truth, <i>your</i> truth, as admitted of the ultimate
    purpose of it, and not the least, slightest doubt of the key you gave
    me to the purpose in question. And so forgive me. Why did you set
    about explaining, as if I were doubting you? When you said once that
    it 'did not come and go,'&mdash;was it not enough? enough to make me feel
    happy as I told you? Did I require you to write a letter like this?
    Now think for a moment, and know once for all, how from the beginning
    to these latter days and through all possible degrees of crisis, you
    have been to my apprehension and gratitude, the best, most consistent,
    most noble ... the words falter that would speak of it all. In nothing
    and at no moment have you&mdash;I will not say&mdash;failed to <i>me</i>, but spoken
    or acted unworthily of yourself at the highest. What have you ever
    been to me except too generous? Ah&mdash;if I had been only half as
    generous, it is true that I never could have seen you again after that
    first meeting&mdash;it was the straight path perhaps. But I had not
    courage&mdash;I shrank from the thought of it&mdash;and then ... besides ... I
    could not believe that your mistake was likely to last,&mdash;I concluded
    that I might keep my friend.
</p>
<p>
    Why should any remembrance be painful to <i>you</i>? I do not understand.
    Unless indeed I should grow painful to you ... I myself!&mdash;seeing that
    every remembered separate thing has brought me nearer to you, and made
    me yours with a deeper trust and love.
</p>
<p>
    And for that letter ... do you fancy that in <i>my</i> memory the sting is
    not gone from it?&mdash;and that I do not carry the thought of it, as the
    Roman maidens, you speak of, their cool harmless snakes, at my heart
    always? So let the poor letter be forgiven, for the sake of the dear
    letter that was burnt, forgiven by <i>you</i>&mdash;until you grow angry with me
    instead&mdash;just till then.
</p>
<p>
    And that you should care so much about the opium! Then <i>I</i> must care,
    and get to do with less&mdash;at least. On the other side of your goodness
    and indulgence (a very little way on the other side) it might strike
    you as strange that I who have had no pain&mdash;no acute suffering to keep
    down from its angles&mdash;should need opium in any shape. But I have had
    restlessness till it made me almost mad: at one time I lost the power
    of sleeping quite&mdash;and even in the day, the continual aching sense of
    weakness has been intolerable&mdash;besides palpitation&mdash;as if one's life,
    instead of giving movement to the body, were imprisoned undiminished
    within it, and beating and fluttering impotently to get out, at all
    the doors and windows. So the medical people gave me opium&mdash;a
    preparation of it, called morphine, and ether&mdash;and ever since I have
    been calling it my amreeta draught, my elixir,&mdash;because the
    tranquillizing power has been wonderful. Such a nervous system I
    have&mdash;so irritable naturally, and so shattered by various causes, that
    the need has continued in a degree until now, and it would be
    dangerous to leave off the calming remedy, Mr. Jago says, except very
    slowly and gradually. But slowly and gradually something may be
    done&mdash;and you are to understand that I never <i>increased</i> upon the
    prescribed quantity ... prescribed in the first instance&mdash;no! Now
    think of my writing all this to you!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And after all the lotus-eaters are blessed beyond the opium-eaters;
    and the best of lotuses are such thoughts as I know.
</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss Mitford comes to-morrow, and I am not glad enough. Shall I
    have a letter to make me glad? She will talk, talk, talk ... and I
    shall be hoping all day that not a word may be talked of ... <i>you</i>:&mdash;a
    forlorn hope indeed! There's a hope for a day like Thursday which is
    just in the middle between a Tuesday and a Saturday!
</p>
<p>
    Your head ... is it ... <i>how</i> is it? tell me. And consider again if it
    could be possible that I could ever desire to reproach <i>you</i> ... in
    what I said about the letter.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you, best and dearest. If you are the <i>compensation</i>
    blessed is the evil that fell upon me: and <i>that</i>, I can say before
    God.

</p>
<p>
    If I said you 'gave me pain' in anything, it was in the only way ever
    possible for you, my dearest&mdash;by giving <i>yourself</i>, in me, pain&mdash;being
    unjust to your own right and power as I feel them at my heart: and in
    that way, I see you will go on to the end, I getting called&mdash;in this
    very letter&mdash;'generous' &amp;c. Well, let me fancy you see very, very deep
    into future chances and how I should behave on occasion. I shall
    hardly imitate you, I whose sense of the present and its claims of
    gratitude already is beyond expression.
</p>
<p>
    All the kind explaining about the opium makes me happier. 'Slowly and
    gradually' what may <i>not</i> be done? Then see the bright weather while I
    write&mdash;lilacs, hawthorn, plum-trees all in bud; elders in leaf,
    rose-bushes with great red shoots; thrushes, whitethroats, hedge
    sparrows in full song&mdash;there can, let us hope, be nothing worse in
    store than a sharp wind, a week of it perhaps&mdash;and then comes what
    shall come&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    And Miss Mitford yesterday&mdash;and has she fresh fears for you of my evil
    influence and Origenic power of 'raying out darkness' like a swart
    star? Why, the common sense of the world teaches that there is nothing
    people at fault in any faculty of expression are so intolerant of as
    the like infirmity in others&mdash;whether they are unconscious of, or
    indulgent to their own obscurity and fettered organ, the hindrance
    from the fettering of their neighbours' is redoubled. A man may think
    he is not deaf, or, at least, that you need not be so much annoyed by
    his deafness as you profess&mdash;but he will be quite aware, to say the
    least of it, when another man can't hear <i>him</i>; he will certainly not
    encourage him to stop his ears. And so with the converse; a writer who
    fails to make himself understood, as presumably in my case, may either
    believe in his heart that it is <i>not</i> so ... that only as much
    attention and previous instructedness as the case calls for, would
    quite avail to understand him; or he may open his eyes to the fact and
    be trying hard to overcome it: but on which supposition is he led to
    confirm another in his unintelligibility? By the proverbial tenderness
    of the eye with the mote for the eye with the beam? If that beam were
    just such another mote&mdash;<i>then</i> one might sympathize and feel no such
    inconvenience&mdash;but, because I have written a 'Sordello,' do I turn to
    just its <i>double</i>, Sordello the second, in your books, and so perforce
    see nothing wrong? 'No'&mdash;it is supposed&mdash;'but something <i>as</i> obscure
    in its way.' Then down goes the bond of union at once, and I stand no
    nearer to view your work than the veriest proprietor of one thought
    and the two words that express it without obscurity at all&mdash;'bricks
    and mortar.' Of course an artist's whole problem must be, as Carlyle
    wrote to me, 'the expressing with articulate clearness the thought in
    him'&mdash;I am almost inclined to say that <i>clear expression</i> should be
    his only work and care&mdash;for he is born, ordained, such as he is&mdash;and
    not born learned in putting what was born in him into words&mdash;what ever
    <i>can</i> be clearly spoken, ought to be. But 'bricks and mortar' is very
    easily said&mdash;and some of the thoughts in 'Sordello' not so readily
    even if Miss Mitford were to try her hand on them.
</p>
<p>
    I look forward to a real life's work for us both. <i>I</i> shall do
    all,&mdash;under your eyes and with your hand in mine,&mdash;all I was intended
    to do: may but <i>you</i> as surely go perfecting&mdash;by continuing&mdash;the work
    begun so wonderfully&mdash;'a rose-tree that beareth seven-times seven'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I am forced to dine in town to-day with an old friend&mdash;'to-morrow'
    always begins half the day before, like a Jewish sabbath. Did your
    sister tell you that I met her on the stairs last time? She did <i>not</i>
    tell you that I had almost passed by her&mdash;the eyes being still
    elsewhere and occupied. Now let me write out that&mdash;no&mdash;I will send the
    old ballad I told you of, for the strange coincidence&mdash;and it is very
    charming beside, is it not? Now goodbye, my sweetest, dearest&mdash;and
    tell me good news of yourself to-morrow, and be but half a quarter as
    glad to see me as I shall be blessed in seeing you. God bless you

    with speech-making, with a long tiresome walk at the end of it&mdash;these

    I felt it must be so ... that something must be the matter, ... and I
    had been so really unhappy for half an hour, that your letter which
    comes now at four, seems a little better, with all its bad news, than
    my fancies took upon themselves to be, without instruction. Now <i>was</i>
    it right to go out yesterday when you were unwell, and to a great
    dinner?&mdash;but I shall not reproach you, dearest, dearest&mdash;I have no
    heart for it at this moment. As to Monday, of course it is as you like
    ... if you are well enough on Monday ... if it should be thought wise
    of you to come to London through the noise ... if ... you understand
    all the <i>ifs</i> ... and among them the greatest if of all, ... for if
    you do love me ... <i>care</i> for me even, you will not do yourself harm
    or run any risk of harm by going out <i>anywhere too soon</i>. On Monday,
    in case you are <i>considered well enough</i>, and otherwise Tuesday,
    Wednesday&mdash;I leave it to you. Still I <i>will</i> ask one thing, whether
    you come on Monday or not. <i>Let</i> me have a single line by the nearest
    post to say how you are. Perhaps for to-night it is not possible&mdash;oh
    no, it is nearly five now! but a word written on Sunday would be with
    me early on Monday morning, and I know you will let me have it, to
    save some of the anxious thoughts ... to break them in their course
    with some sort of certainty! May God bless you dearest of all!&mdash;I
    thought of you on Thursday, but did not speak of you, not even when
    Miss Mitford called Hood the greatest poet of the age ... she had been
    depreciating Carlyle, so I let you lie and wait on the same level, ...
    that shelf of the rock which is above tide mark! I was glad even, that
    she did not speak of you; and, under cover of her speech of others, I
    had my thoughts of you deeply and safely. When she had gone at half
    past six, moreover, I grew over-hopeful, and made up my fancy to have
    a letter at eight! The branch she had pulled down, sprang upward
    skyward ... to that high possibility of a letter! Which did not come
    that day ... no!&mdash;and I revenged myself by writing a letter to <i>you</i>,
    which was burnt afterwards because I would not torment you for
    letters. Last night, came a real one&mdash;dearest! So we could not keep
    our sabbath to-day! It is a fast day instead, ... on my part. How
    should I feel (I have been thinking to myself), if I did not see you
    on Saturday, and could not hope to see you on Monday, nor on Tuesday,
    nor on Wednesday, nor Thursday nor Friday, nor Saturday again&mdash;if all
    the sabbaths were gone out of the world for me! May God bless you!&mdash;it

    Ever dearest, I have been possessed by your 'Luria' just as you would
    have me, and I should like you to understand, not simply how fine a
    conception the whole work seems to me, so developed, but how it has
    moved and affected me, without the ordinary means and dialect of
    pathos, by that calm attitude of moral grandeur which it has&mdash;it is
    very fine. For the execution, <i>that</i> too is worthily done&mdash;although I
    agree with you, that a little quickening and drawing in closer here
    and there, especially towards the close where there is no time to
    lose, the reader feels, would make the effect stronger&mdash;but you will
    look to it yourself&mdash;and such a conception <i>must</i> come in thunder and
    lightning, as a chief god would&mdash;<i>must</i> make its own way ... and will
    not let its poet go until he speaks it out to the ultimate syllable.
    Domizia disappoints me rather. You might throw a flash more of light
    on her face&mdash;might you not? But what am I talking? I think it a
    magnificent work&mdash;a noble exposition of the ingratitude of men against
    their 'heroes,' and (what is peculiar) an <i>humane</i> exposition ... not
    misanthropical, after the usual fashion of such things: for the
    return, the remorse, saves it&mdash;and the 'Too late' of the repentance
    and compensation covers with its solemn toll the fate of persecutors
    and victim. We feel that Husain himself could only say afterward ...
    '<i>That is done.</i>' And now&mdash;surely you think well of the work as a
    whole? You cannot doubt, I fancy, of the grandeur of it&mdash;and of the
    <i>subtilty</i> too, for it is subtle&mdash;too subtle perhaps for stage
    purposes, though as clear, ... as to expression ... as to medium ...
    as 'bricks and mortar' ... shall I say?

    are&mdash;unreasonable!&mdash;Well! you will write now&mdash;you will answer what I
    am writing, and mention yourself particularly and sincerely&mdash;Remember!
    Above all, you will care for your head. I have been thinking since
    yesterday that, coming out of the cold, you might not have refused as
    usual to take something ... hot wine and water, or coffee? Will you
    have coffee with me on Saturday? 'Shunning the salt,' will you have
    the sugar? And do tell me, for I have been thinking, are you careful
    as to diet&mdash;and will such sublunary things as coffee and tea and cocoa
    affect your head&mdash;<i>for</i> or <i>against</i>! Then you do not touch wine&mdash;and
    perhaps you ought. Surely something may be found or done to do you
    good. If it had not been for me, you would be travelling in Italy by
    this time and quite well perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    This morning I had a letter from Miss Martineau and really read it to
    the end without thinking it too long, which is extraordinary for me
    just now, and scarcely ordinary in the letter, and indeed it is a
    delightful letter, as letters go, which are not yours! You shall take
    it with you on Saturday to read, and you shall see that it is worth
    reading, and interesting for Wordsworth's sake and her own. Mr.
    Kenyon has it now, because he presses on to have her letters, and I
    should not like to tell him that you had it first from me.... Also
    Saturday will be time enough.
</p>
<p>
    Oh&mdash;poor Mr. Horne! shall I tell you some of his offences? That he
    desires to be called at four in the morning, and does not get up till
    eight. That he pours libations on his bare head out of the
    water-glasses at great dinners. That being in the midst of
    sportsmen&mdash;rural aristocrats&mdash;lords of soil&mdash;and all talking learnedly
    of pointers' noses and spaniels' ears; he has exclaimed aloud in a
    mocking paraphrase&mdash;'If I were to hold up a horse by the tail.' The
    wit is certainly doubtful!&mdash;That being asked to dinner on Tuesday, he
    will go on Wednesday instead.&mdash;That he throws himself at full length
    with a gesture approaching to a 'summerset' on satin sofas. That he
    giggles. That he only <i>thinks</i> he can talk. That his ignorance on all
    subjects is astounding. That he never read the old ballads, nor saw
    Percy's collection. That he asked <i>who</i> wrote 'Drink to me only with
    thine eyes.' That after making himself ridiculous in attempting to
    speak at a public meeting, he said to a compassionate friend 'I got
    very well out of <i>that</i>.' That, in writing his work on Napoleon, he
    employed a man to study the subject for him. That he cares for
    nobody's poetry or fame except his own, and considers Tennyson chiefly
    illustrious as being his contemporary. That, as to politics, he
    doesn't care '<i>which</i> side.' That he is always talking of 'my shares,'
    'my income,' as if he were a Kilmansegg. Lastly (and understand, this
    is <i>my</i> 'lastly' and not Miss Mitford's, who is far from being out of
    breath so soon) that he has a mania for heiresses&mdash;that he has gone
    out at half past five and 'proposed' to Miss M or N with fifty
    thousand pounds, and being rejected (as the lady thought fit to report
    herself) came back to tea and the same evening 'fell in love' with
    Miss O or P ... with forty thousand&mdash;went away for a few months, and
    upon his next visit, did as much to a Miss Q or W, on the promise of
    four blood horses&mdash;has a prospect now of a Miss R or S&mdash;with hounds,
    perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    Too, too bad&mdash;isn't it? I would repeat none of it except to you&mdash;and
    as to the worst part, the last, why some may be coincidence, and some,
    exaggeration, for I have not the least doubt that every now and then a
    fine poetical compliment was turned into a serious thing by the
    listener, and then the poor poet had critics as well as listeners all
    round him. Also, he rather 'wears his heart on his sleeve,' there is
    no denying&mdash;and in other respects he is not much better, perhaps, than
    other men. But for the base traffic of the affair&mdash;I do not believe a
    word. He is too generous&mdash;has too much real sensibility. I fought his
    battle, poor Orion. 'And so,' she said 'you believe it possible for a
    disinterested man to become really attached to two women, heiresses,
    on the same day?' I doubted the <i>fact</i>. And then she showed me a note,
    an autograph note from the poet, confessing the M or N part of the
    business&mdash;while Miss O or P confessed herself, said Miss Mitford. But
    I persisted in doubting, notwithstanding the lady's confessions, or
    convictions, as they might be. And just think of Mr. Horne not having
    tact enough to keep out of these multitudinous scrapes, for those few
    days which on three separate occasions he paid Miss Mitford in a
    neighbourhood where all were strangers to him,&mdash;and never outstaying
    his week! He must have been <i>foolish</i>, read it all how we may.
</p>
<p>
    And so am <i>I</i>, to write this 'personal talk' to you when you will not
    care for it&mdash;yet you asked me, and it may make you smile, though
    Wordsworth's tea-kettle outsings it all.
</p>
<p>
    When your Monday letter came, I was reading the criticism on Hunt and
    his Italian poets, in the <i>Examiner</i>. How I liked to be pulled by the
    sleeve to your translations!&mdash;How I liked everything!&mdash;Pulci, Pietro
    ... and you, best!
</p>
<p>
    Yet here's a naiveté which I found in your letter! I will write it out
    that you may read it&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    'However it' (the headache) 'was no sooner gone in a degree, than a
    worse plague came&mdash;<i>I sate thinking of you</i>.'
</p>
<p>
    Very satisfactory <i>that</i> is, and very clear.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you dearest, dearest! Be careful of yourself. The cold
    makes me <i>languid</i>, as heat is apt to make everybody; but I am not
    unwell, and keep up the fire and the thoughts of you.

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, February 11, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    My sweetest 'plague,' <i>did</i> I really write that sentence so, without
    gloss or comment in close vicinity? I can hardly think it&mdash;but you
    know well, well where the real plague lay,&mdash;that I thought of you as
    thinking, in your infinite goodness, of untoward chances which had
    kept me from you&mdash;and if I did not dwell more particularly on that
    thinking of <i>yours</i>, which became as I say, in the knowledge of it, a
    plague when brought before me <i>with</i> the thought of you,&mdash;if I passed
    this slightly over it was for pure unaffected shame that I should take
    up the care and stop the 'reverie serene' of&mdash;ah, the rhyme <i>lets</i> me
    say&mdash;'sweetest eyes were ever seen'&mdash;were <i>ever</i> seen! And yourself
    confess, in the Saturday's note, to having been 'unhappy for half an
    hour till' &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and do not I feel <i>that</i> here, and am not I
    plagued by it?
</p>
<p>
    Well, having begun at the end of your letter, dearest, I will go back
    gently (that is backwards) and tell you I 'sate thinking' too, and
    with no greater comfort, on the cold yesterday. The pond before the
    window was frozen ('so as to bear sparrows' somebody said) and I knew
    you would feel it&mdash;'but you are not unwell'&mdash;really? thank God&mdash;and
    the month wears on. Beside I have got a reassurance&mdash;you asked me once
    if I were superstitious, I remember (as what do I forget that you
    say?). However that may be, yesterday morning as I turned to look for
    a book, an old fancy seized me to try the 'sortes' and dip into the
    first page of the first I chanced upon, for my fortune; I said 'what
    will be the event of my love for Her'&mdash;in so many words&mdash;and my book
    turned out to be&mdash;'Cerutti's Italian Grammar!'&mdash;a propitious source of
    information ... the best to be hoped, what could it prove but some
    assurance that you were in the Dative Case, or I, not in the ablative
    absolute? I do protest that, with the knowledge of so many horrible
    pitfalls, or rather spring guns with wires on every bush ... such
    dreadful possibilities of stumbling on 'conditional moods,' 'imperfect
    tenses,' 'singular numbers,'&mdash;I should have been too glad to put up
    with the safe spot for the sole of my foot though no larger than
    afforded by such a word as 'Conjunction,' 'possessive pronoun&mdash;,'
    secure so far from poor Tippet's catastrophe. Well, I ventured, and
    what did I find? <i>This</i>&mdash;which I copy from the book now&mdash;'<i>If we love
    in the other world as we do in this, I shall love thee to
    eternity</i>'&mdash;from 'Promiscuous Exercises,' to be translated into
    Italian, at the end.
</p>
<p>
    And now I reach Horne and his characteristics&mdash;of which I can tell you
    with confidence that they are grossly misrepresented where not
    altogether false&mdash;whether it proceed from inability to see what one
    may see, or disinclination, I cannot say. I know very little of Horne,
    but my one visit to him a few weeks ago would show the uncandidness of
    those charges: for instance, he talked a good deal about horses,
    meaning to ride in Ireland, and described very cleverly an old hunter
    he had hired once,&mdash;how it galloped and could not walk; also he
    propounded a theory of the true method of behaving in the saddle when
    a horse rears, which I besought him only to practise in fancy on the
    sofa, where he lay telling it. So much for professing his ignorance in
    that matter! On a sofa he does throw himself&mdash;but when thrown there,
    he can talk, with Miss Mitford's leave, admirably,&mdash;I never heard
    better stories than Horne's&mdash;some Spanish-American incidents of travel
    want printing&mdash;or have been printed, for aught I know. That he cares
    for nobody's poetry is <i>false</i>, he praises more unregardingly of his
    own retreat, more unprovidingly for his own fortune,&mdash;(do I speak
    clearly?)&mdash;less like a man who himself has written somewhat in the
    'line' of the other man he is praising&mdash;which 'somewhat' has to be
    guarded in its interests, &amp;c., less like the poor professional praise
    of the 'craft' than any other I ever met&mdash;instance after instance
    starting into my mind as I write. To his income I never heard him
    allude&mdash;unless one should so interpret a remark to me this last time
    we met, that he had been on some occasion put to inconvenience by
    somebody's withholding ten or twelve pounds due to him for an article,
    and promised in the confidence of getting them to a tradesman, which
    does not look like 'boasting of his income'! As for the heiresses&mdash;I
    don't believe one word of it, of the succession and transition and
    trafficking. Altogether, what miserable 'set-offs' to the achievement
    of an 'Orion,' a 'Marlowe,' a 'Delora'! Miss Martineau understands him
    better.
</p>
<p>
    Now I come to myself and my health. I am quite well now&mdash;at all
    events, much better, just a little turning in the head&mdash;since you
    appeal to my sincerity. For the coffee&mdash;thank you, indeed thank you,
    but nothing after the '<i>oenomel</i>' and before half past six. <i>I</i> know
    all about that song and its Greek original if Horne does not&mdash;and can
    tell you&mdash;, how truly...!
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doth ask a drink divine&mdash;<br>
But might I of Jove's nectar sup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would not change for thine! <i>No, no, no!</i>
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">And by the bye, I have misled you as my wont is, on the subject of
    wine, 'that I do not touch it'&mdash;not habitually, nor so as to feel the
    loss of it, that on a principle; but every now and then of course.
</p>
<p>
    And now, 'Luria', so long as the parts cohere and the whole is
    discernible, all will be well yet. I shall not look at it, nor think
    of it, for a week or two, and then see what I have forgotten. Domizia
    is all wrong; I told you I knew that her special colour had faded,&mdash;it
    was but a bright line, and the more distinctly deep that it was so
    narrow. One of my half dozen words on my scrap of paper 'pro memoria'
    was, under the 'Act V.' '<i>she loves</i>'&mdash;to which I could not bring it,
    you see! Yet the play requires it still,&mdash;something may yet be
    effected, though.... I meant that she should propose to go to Pisa
    with him, and begin a new life. But there is no hurry&mdash;I suppose it is
    no use publishing much before Easter&mdash;I will try and remember what my
    whole character <i>did</i> mean&mdash;it was, in two words, understood at the
    time by 'panther's-beauty'&mdash;on which hint I ought to have spoken! But
    the work grew cold, and you came between, and the sun put out the fire
    on the hearth <i>nec vult panthera domari</i>!
</p>
<p>
    For the 'Soul's Tragedy'&mdash;<i>that</i> will surprise you, I think. There is
    no trace of you there,&mdash;you have not put out the black face of
    <i>it</i>&mdash;it is all sneering and <i>disillusion</i>&mdash;and shall not be printed
    but burned if you say the word&mdash;now wait and see and then say! I will
    bring the first of the two parts next Saturday.
</p>
<p>
    And now, dearest, I am with you&mdash;and the other matters are forgotten
    already. God bless you, I am ever your own R. You will write to me I
    trust? And tell me how to bear the cold.
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, February 12, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ah, the 'sortes'! Is it a double oracle&mdash;'swan and shadow'&mdash;do you
    think? or do my eyes see double, dazzled by the light of it? 'I shall
    love thee to eternity'&mdash;I <i>shall</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And as for the wine, I did not indeed misunderstand you 'as my wont
    is,' because I understood simply that 'habitually' you abstained from
    wine, and I meant exactly that perhaps it would be better for your
    health to take it habitually. It <i>might</i>, you know&mdash;not that I pretend
    to advise. Only when you look so much too pale sometimes, it comes
    into one's thoughts that you ought not to live on cresses and cold
    water. Strong coffee, which is the nearest to a stimulant that I dare
    to take, as far as ordinary diet goes, will almost always deliver <i>me</i>
    from the worst of headaches, but there is no likeness, no comparison.
    And your 'quite well' means that dreadful 'turning' still ... still!
    Now do not think any more of the Domizias, nor 'try to remember,'
    which is the most wearing way of thinking. The more I read and read
    your 'Luria,' the grander it looks, and it will make its own road with
    all understanding men, you need not doubt, and still less need you try
    to make me uneasy about the harm I have done in 'coming between,' and
    all the rest of it. I wish never to do you greater harm than just
    <i>that</i>, and then with a white conscience 'I shall love thee to
    eternity!... dearest! You have made a golden work out of your
    'golden-hearted Luria'&mdash;as once you called him to me, and I hold it in
    the highest admiration&mdash;<i>should</i>, if you were precisely nothing to me.
    And still, the fifth act <i>rises</i>! That is certain. Nevertheless I seem
    to agree with you that your hand has vacillated in your Domizia. We do
    not know her with as full a light on her face, as the other
    persons&mdash;we do not see the <i>panther</i>,&mdash;no, certainly we do not&mdash;but
    you will do a very little for her which will be everything, after a
    time ... and I assure you that if you were to ask for the manuscript
    before, you should not have a page of it&mdash;<i>now</i>, you are only to rest.
    What a work to rest upon! Do consider what a triumph it is! The more I
    read, the more I think of it, the greater it grows&mdash;and as to 'faded
    lines,' you never cut a pomegranate that was redder in the deep of it.
    Also, no one can say 'This is not clearly written.' The people who are
    at 'words of one syllable' may be puzzled by you and Wordsworth
    together this time ... as far as the expression goes. Subtle thoughts
    you always must have, in and out of 'Sordello'&mdash;and the objectors
    would find even Plato (though his medium is as lucid as the water that
    ran beside the beautiful plane-tree!) a little difficult perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    To-day Mr. Kenyon came, and do you know, he has made a beatific
    confusion between last Saturday and next Saturday, and said to me he
    had told Miss Thomson to mind to come on Friday if she wished to see
    me ... 'remembering' (he added) 'that Mr. Browning took <i>Saturday</i>!!'
    So I let him mistake the one week for the other&mdash;'Mr. Browning took
    Saturday,' it was true, both ways. Well&mdash;and then he went on to tell
    me that he had heard from Mrs. Jameson who was at Brighton and unwell,
    and had written to say this and that to him, and to enquire
    besides&mdash;now, what do you think, she enquired besides? 'how you and
    ... Browning were' said Mr. Kenyon&mdash;I write his words. He is coming,
    perhaps to-morrow, or perhaps Sunday&mdash;Saturday is to have a twofold
    safety. That is, if you are not ill again. Dearest, you will not think
    of coming if you are ill ... unwell even. I shall not be frightened
    next time, as I told you&mdash;I shall have the precedent. Before, I had to
    think! 'It has never happened <i>so</i>&mdash;there must be a cause&mdash;and if it
    is a very, very, bad cause, why no one will tell <i>me</i> ... it will not
    seem <i>my</i> concern'&mdash;<i>that</i> was my thought on Saturday. But another
    time ... only, if it is possible to keep well, do keep well, beloved,
    and think of me instead of Domizia, and let there be no other time for
    your suffering ... my waiting is nothing. I shall remember for the
    future that you may have the headache&mdash;and do you remember it too!
</p>
<p>
    For Mr. Horne I take your testimony gladly and believingly. <i>She
    blots</i> with her <i>eyes</i> sometimes. She hates ... and loves, in extreme
    degrees. We have, once or twice or thrice, been on the border of
    mutual displeasure, on this very subject, for I grew really vexed to
    observe the trust on one side and the <i>dyspathy</i> on the other&mdash;using
    the mildest of words. You see, he found himself, down in Berkshire, in
    quite a strange element of society,&mdash;he, an artist in his good and his
    evil,&mdash;and the people there, 'county families,' smoothly plumed in
    their conventions, and classing the ringlets and the aboriginal way of
    using water-glasses among offences against the Moral Law. Then,
    meaning to be agreeable, or fascinating perhaps, made it twenty times
    worse. Writing in albums about the graces, discoursing meditated
    impromptus at picnics, playing on the guitar in fancy dresses,&mdash;all
    these things which seemed to poor Orion as natural as his own stars I
    dare say, and just the things suited to the <i>genus</i> poet, and to
    himself specifically,&mdash;were understood by the natives and their 'rural
    deities' to signify, that he intended to marry one half the county,
    and to run away with the other. But Miss Mitford should have known
    better&mdash;<i>she</i> should. And she <i>would</i> have known better, if she had
    liked him&mdash;for the liking could have been unmade by no such offences.
    She is too fervent a friend&mdash;she can be. Generous too, she can be
    without an effort; and I have had much affection from her&mdash;and accuse
    myself for seeming to have less&mdash;but&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you!&mdash;I end in haste after this long lingering.

<p style="text-align: right">Friday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, February 13, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Two nights ago I read the 'Soul's Tragedy' once more, and though there
    were not a few points which still struck me as successful in design
    and execution, yet on the whole I came to a decided opinion, that it
    will be better to postpone the publication of it for the present. It
    is not a good ending, an auspicious wind-up of this series;
    subject-matter and style are alike unpopular even for the literary
    <i>grex</i> that stands aloof from the purer <i>plebs</i>, and uses that
    privilege to display and parade an ignorance which the other is
    altogether unconscious of&mdash;so that, if 'Luria' is <i>clearish</i>, the
    'Tragedy' would be an unnecessary troubling the waters. Whereas, if I
    printed it first in order, my readers, according to custom, would make
    the (comparatively) little they did not see into, a full excuse for
    shutting their eyes at the rest, and we may as well part friends, so
    as not to meet enemies. But, at bottom, I believe the proper objection
    is to the immediate, <i>first</i> effect of the whole&mdash;its moral
    effect&mdash;which is dependent on the contrary supposition of its being
    really understood, in the main drift of it. Yet I don't know; for I
    wrote it with the intention of producing the best of all
    effects&mdash;perhaps the truth is, that I am tired, rather, and desirous
    of getting done, and 'Luria' will answer my purpose so far. Will not
    the best way be to reserve this unlucky play and in the event of a
    second edition&mdash;as Moxon seems to think such an apparition
    possible&mdash;might not this be quietly inserted?&mdash;in its place, too, for
    it was written two or three years ago. I have lost, of late, interest
    in dramatic writing, as you know, and, perhaps, occasion. And,
    dearest, I mean to take your advice and be quiet awhile and let my
    mind get used to its new medium of sight; seeing all things, as it
    does, through you: and then, let all I have done be the prelude and
    the real work begin. I felt it would be so before, and told you at the
    very beginning&mdash;do you remember? And you spoke of Io 'in the proem.'
    How much more should follow now!
</p>
<p>
    And if nothing follows, I have <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
    I shall see you to-morrow and be happy. To-day&mdash;is it the weather or
    what?&mdash;something depresses me a little&mdash;to-morrow brings the remedy
    for it all. I don't know why I mention such a matter; except that I
    tell you everything without a notion of after-consequence; and because
    your dearest, dearest presence seems under any circumstances as if
    created just to help me <i>there</i>; if my spirits rise they fly to you;
    if they fall, they hold by you and cease falling&mdash;as now. Bless you,
    Ba&mdash;my own best blessing that you are! But a few hours and I am with
    you, beloved!

<p>
    Ever dearest, though you wanted to make me say one thing displeasing
    to you to-day, I had not courage to say two instead ... which I might
    have done indeed and indeed! For I am capable of thinking both
    thoughts of 'next year,' as you suggested them:&mdash;because while you are
    with me I see only <i>you</i>, and you being you, I cannot doubt a power of
    yours nor measure the deep loving nature which I feel to be so
    deep&mdash;so that there may be ever so many 'mores,' and no 'more' wonder
    of mine!&mdash;but afterwards, when the door is shut and there is no 'more'
    light nor speaking until Thursday, why <i>then</i>, that I do not see <i>you</i>
    but <i>me</i>,&mdash;<i>then</i> comes the reaction,&mdash;the natural lengthening of the
    shadows at sunset,&mdash;and <i>then</i>, the 'less, less, less' grows to seem
    as natural to my fate, as the 'more' seemed to your nature&mdash;I being I!

<p>
    <i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Well!&mdash;you are to try to forgive it all! And the truth,
    over and under all, is, that I scarcely ever do think of the future,
    scarcely ever further than to your next visit, and almost never
    beyond, except for your sake and in reference to that view of the
    question which I have vexed you with so often, in fearing for your
    happiness. Once it was a habit of mind with me to live altogether in
    what I called the future&mdash;but the tops of the trees that looked
    towards Troy were broken off in the great winds, and falling down into
    the river beneath, where now after all this time they grow green
    again, I let them float along the current gently and pleasantly. Can
    it be better I wonder! And if it becomes worse, can I help it? Also
    the future never seemed to belong to me so little&mdash;never! It might
    appear wonderful to most persons, it is startling even to myself
    sometimes, to observe how free from anxiety I am&mdash;from the sort of
    anxiety which might be well connected with my own position <i>here</i>, and
    which is personal to myself. <i>That</i> is all thrown behind&mdash;into the
    bushes&mdash;long ago it was, and I think I told you of it before.
    Agitation comes from indecision&mdash;and <i>I</i> was decided from the first
    hour when I admitted the possibility of your loving me really.
    Now,&mdash;as the Euphuists used to say,&mdash;I am 'more thine than my own' ...
    it is a literal truth&mdash;and my future belongs to you; if it was mine,
    it was mine to give, and if it was mine to give, it was given, and if
    it was given ... beloved....
</p>
<p>
    So you see!
</p>
<p>
    Then I will confess to you that all my life long I have had a rather
    strange sympathy and dyspathy&mdash;the sympathy having concerned the genus
    <i>jilt</i> (as vulgarly called) male and female&mdash;and the dyspathy&mdash;the
    whole class of heroically virtuous persons who make sacrifices of what
    they call 'love' to what they call 'duty.' There are exceptional cases
    of course, but, for the most part, I listen incredulously or else with
    a little contempt to those latter proofs of strength&mdash;or weakness, as
    it may be:&mdash;people are not usually praised for giving up their
    religion, for unsaying their oaths, for desecrating their 'holy
    things'&mdash;while believing them still to be religious and sacramental!
    On the other side I have always and shall always understand how it is
    possible for the most earnest and faithful of men and even of women
    perhaps, to err in the convictions of the heart as well as of the
    mind, to profess an affection which is an illusion, and to recant and
    retreat loyally at the eleventh hour, on becoming aware of the truth
    which is in them. Such men are the truest of men, and the most
    courageous for the truth's sake, and instead of blaming them I hold
    them in honour, for me, and always did and shall.
</p>
<p>
    And while I write, you are 'very ill'&mdash;very ill!&mdash;how it looks,
    written down <i>so</i>! When you were gone yesterday and my thoughts had
    tossed about restlessly for ever so long, I was wise enough to ask
    Wilson how <i>she</i> thought you were looking, ... and she 'did not know'
    ... she 'had not observed' ... 'only certainly Mr. Browning ran
    up-stairs instead of walking as he did the time before.'
</p>
<p>
    Now promise me dearest, dearest&mdash;not to trifle with your health. Not
    to neglect yourself ... not to tire yourself ... and besides to take
    the advice of your medical friend as to diet and general
    treatment:&mdash;because there must be a wrong and a right in everything,
    and the right is very important under your circumstances ... if you
    have a tendency to illness. It may be right for you to have wine for
    instance. Did you ever try the putting your feet into hot water at
    night, to prevent the recurrence of the morning headache&mdash;for the
    affection of the head comes on early in the morning, does it not? just
    as if the sleeping did you harm. Now I have heard of such a remedy
    doing good&mdash;and could it <i>increase</i> the evil?&mdash;mustard mixed with the
    water, remember. Everything approaching to <i>congestion</i> is full of
    fear&mdash;I tremble to think of it&mdash;and I bring no remedy by this teazing
    neither! But you will not be 'wicked' nor 'unkind,' nor provoke the
    evil consciously&mdash;you will keep quiet and forswear the going out at
    nights, the excitement and noise of parties, and the worse excitement
    of composition&mdash;you promise. If you knew how I keep thinking of you,
    and at intervals grow so frightened! Think <i>you</i>, that you are three
    times as much to me as I can be to you at best and greatest,&mdash;because
    you are more than three times the larger planet&mdash;and because too, you
    have known other sources of light and happiness ... but I need not say
    this&mdash;and I shall hear on Monday, and may trust to you every day ...
    may I not? Yet I would trust my soul to you sooner than your own
    health.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you, dear, dearest. If the first part of the 'Soul's
    Tragedy' should be written out, I can read <i>that</i> perhaps, without
    drawing you in to think of the second. Still it may be safer to keep
    off altogether for the present&mdash;and let it be as you incline. I do not
    speak of 'Luria.'
</p>

</p>
<p>
    If it were not for Mr. Kenyon, I should say, almost, Wednesday,
    instead of Thursday&mdash;I want to see you so much, and to see for myself
    about the looks and spirits, only it would not do if he found you here
    on Wednesday. Let him come to-morrow or on Tuesday, and Wednesday will
    be safe&mdash;shall we consider? what do you think?

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Afternoon.<br>
[Post-mark, February 16, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Here is the letter again, dearest: I suppose it gives me the same
    pleasure, in reading, as you&mdash;and Mr. K. as me, and anybody else as
    him; if all the correspondence which was claimed again and burnt on
    some principle or other some years ago be at all of the nature of this
    sample, the measure seems questionable. Burn anybody's <i>real</i>
    letters, well and good: they move and live&mdash;the thoughts, feelings,
    and expressions even,&mdash;in a self-imposed circle limiting the
    experience of two persons only&mdash;<i>there</i> is the standard, and to <i>that</i>
    the appeal&mdash;how should a third person know? His presence breaks the
    line, so to speak, and lets in a whole tract of country on the
    originally inclosed spot&mdash;so that its trees, which were from side to
    side there, seem left alone and wondering at their sudden unimportance
    in the broad land; while its 'ferns such as I never saw before' and
    which have been petted proportionably, look extravagant enough amid
    the new spread of good honest grey grass that is now the earth's
    general wear. So that the significance is lost at once, and whole
    value of such letters&mdash;the cypher changed, the vowel-points removed:
    but how can that affect clever writing like this? What do you, to whom
    it is addressed, see in it more than the world that wants to see it
    and shan't have it? One understands shutting an unprivileged eye to
    the ineffable mysteries of those 'upper-rooms,' now that the broom and
    dust pan, stocking-mending and gingerbread-making are invested with
    such unforeseen reverence ... but the carriage-sweep and quarry,
    together with Jane and our baskets, and a pleasant shadow of
    Wordsworth's Sunday hat preceding his own rapid strides in the
    direction of Miss Fenwick's house&mdash;surely, 'men's eyes were made to
    see, so let them gaze' at all <i>this</i>! And so I, gazing with a clear
    conscience, am very glad to hear so much good of a very good person
    and so well told. She plainly sees the proper use and advantage of a
    country-life; and <i>that</i> knowledge gets to seem a high point of
    attainment doubtless by the side of the Wordsworth she speaks of&mdash;for
    <i>mine</i> he shall not be as long as I am able! Was ever such a '<i>great</i>'
    poet before? Put one trait with the other&mdash;the theory of rural
    innocence&mdash;alternation of 'vulgar trifles' with dissertating with
    style of 'the utmost grandeur that <i>even you</i> can conceive' (speak for
    yourself, Miss M.!)&mdash;and that amiable transition from two o'clock's
    grief at the death of one's brother to three o'clock's happiness in
    the 'extraordinary mesmeric discourse' of one's friend. All this, and
    the rest of the serene and happy inspired daily life which a piece of
    'unpunctuality' can ruin, and to which the guardian 'angel' brings as
    crowning qualification the knack of poking the fire adroitly&mdash;of
    this&mdash;what can one say but that&mdash;no, best hold one's tongue and read
    the 'Lyrical Ballads' with finger in ear. Did not Shelley say long ago
    'He had no more <i>imagination</i> than a pint-pot'&mdash;though in those days
    he used to walk about France and Flanders like a man? <i>Now</i>, he is
    'most comfortable in his worldly affairs' and just this comes of it!
    He lives the best twenty years of his life after the way of his own
    heart&mdash;and when one presses in to see the result of the rare
    experiment ... what the <i>one</i> alchemist whom fortune has allowed to
    get all his coveted materials and set to work at last in earnest with
    fire and melting-pot&mdash;what <i>he</i> produces after all the talk of him and
    the like of him; why, you get <i>pulvis et cinis</i>&mdash;a man at the mercy of
    the tongs and shovel!
</p>
<p>
    Well! Let us despair at nothing, but, wishing success to the newer
    aspirant, expect better things from Miss M. when the 'knoll,' and
    'paradise,' and their facilities, operate properly; and that she will
    make a truer estimate of the importance and responsibilities of
    'authorship' than she does at present, if I understand rightly the
    sense in which she describes her own life as it means to be; for in
    one sense it is all good and well, and quite natural that she should
    like 'that sort of strenuous handwork' better than book-making; like
    the play better than the labour, as we are apt to do. If she realises
    a very ordinary scheme of literary life, planned under the eye of God
    not 'the public,' and prosecuted under the constant sense of the
    night's coming which ends it good or bad&mdash;then, she will be sure to
    'like' the rest and sport&mdash;teaching her maids and sewing her gloves
    and making delicate visitors comfortable&mdash;so much more rational a
    resource is the worst of them than gin-and-water, for instance. But
    if, as I rather suspect, these latter are to figure as a virtual
    <i>half</i> duty of the whole Man&mdash;as of equal importance (on the ground of
    the innocence and utility of such occupations) with the book-making
    aforesaid&mdash;always supposing <i>that</i> to be of the right kind&mdash;<i>then</i> I
    respect Miss M. just as I should an Archbishop of Canterbury whose
    business was the teaching A.B.C. at an infant-school&mdash;he who might set
    on the Tens to instruct the Hundreds how to convince the Thousands of
    the propriety of doing that and many other things. Of course one will
    respect him only the more if when <i>that</i> matter is off his mind he
    relaxes at such a school instead of over a chess-board; as it will
    increase our love for Miss M. to find that making 'my good Jane (from
    Tyne-mouth)'&mdash;'happier and&mdash;I hope&mdash;wiser' is an amusement, or more,
    after the day's progress towards the 'novel for next year' which is to
    inspire thousands, beyond computation, with the ardour of making
    innumerable other Janes and delicate relatives happier and wiser&mdash;who
    knows but as many as Burns did, and does, so make happier and wiser?
    Only, <i>his quarry</i> and after-solace was that 'marble bowl often
    replenished with whiskey' on which Dr. Curry discourses mournfully,
    'Oh, be wiser Thou!'&mdash;and remember it was only <i>after</i> Lord Bacon had
    written to an end <i>his</i> Book&mdash;given us for ever the Art of
    Inventing&mdash;whether steam-engine or improved dust-pan&mdash;that he took on
    himself to do a little exemplary 'hand work'; got out on that cold St.
    Alban's road to stuff a fowl with snow and so keep it fresh, and got
    into his bed and died of the cold in his hands ('strenuous <i>hand</i>
    work'&mdash;) before the snow had time to melt. He did not begin in his
    youth by saying&mdash;'I have a horror of merely writing 'Novum Organums'
    and shall give half my energies to the stuffing fowls'!
</p>
<p>
    All this it is <i>my</i> amusement, of an indifferent kind, to put down
    solely on the pleasant assurance contained in that postscript, of the
    one way of never quarrelling with Miss M.&mdash;'by joining in her plan
    and practice of plain speaking'&mdash;could she but 'get people to do it!'
    Well, she gets me for a beginner: the funny thing would be to know
    what Chorley's desperate utterance amounted to! Did you ever hear of
    the plain speaking of some of the continental lottery-projectors? An
    estate on the Rhine, for instance, is to be disposed of, and the
    holder of the lucky ticket will find himself suddenly owner of a
    mediæval castle with an unlimited number of dependencies&mdash;vineyards,
    woods, pastures, and so forth&mdash;all only waiting the new master's
    arrival&mdash;while inside, all is swept and garnished (not to say,
    varnished)&mdash;the tables are spread, the wines on the board, all is
    ready for the reception <i>but</i> ... here 'plain speaking' becomes
    necessary&mdash;it prevents quarrels, and, could the projector get people
    to practise it as he does all would be well; so he, at least, will
    speak plainly&mdash;you hear what <i>is</i> provided but, he cannot, dares not
    withhold what is <i>not</i>&mdash;there is then, to speak plainly,&mdash;no night
    cap! You <i>will</i> have to bring your own night cap. The projector
    furnishes somewhat, as you hear, but not <i>all</i>&mdash;and now&mdash;the worst is
    heard,&mdash;will you quarrel with him? Will my own dear, dearest Ba please
    and help me here, and fancy Chorley's concessions, and tributes, and
    recognitions, and then, at the very end, the 'plain words,' to
    counterbalance all, that have been to overlook and pardon?
</p>
<p>
    Oh, my own Ba, hear <i>my</i> plain speech&mdash;and how this is <i>not</i> an
    attempt to frighten you out of your dear wish to '<i>hear</i> from me'&mdash;no,
    indeed&mdash;but a whim, a caprice,&mdash;and now it is out! over, done with!
    And now I am with you again&mdash;it is to <i>you</i> I shall write next. Bless
    you, ever&mdash;my beloved. I am much better, indeed&mdash;and mean to be well.
    And you! But I will write&mdash;this goes for nothing&mdash;or only <i>this</i>, that
    I am your very own&mdash;

</p>
<p>
    My long letter is with you, dearest, to show how serious my illness
    was 'while you wrote': unless you find that letter too foolish, as I
    do on twice thinking&mdash;or at all events a most superfluous bestowment
    of handwork while the heart was elsewhere, and with you&mdash;never more
    so! Dear, dear Ba, your adorable goodness sinks into me till it nearly
    pains,&mdash;so exquisite and strange is the pleasure: <i>so</i> you care for
    me, and think of me, and write to me!&mdash;I shall never die for you, and
    if it could be so, what would death prove? But I can live on, your own
    as now,&mdash;utterly your own.
</p>
<p>
    Dear Ba, do you suppose we differ on so plain a point as that of the
    superior wisdom, and generosity, too, of announcing such a change &amp;c.
    at the eleventh hour? There can be no doubt of it,&mdash;and now, what of
    it to me?
</p>
<p>
    But I am not going to write to-day&mdash;only this&mdash;that I am better,
    having not been quite so well last night&mdash;so I shut up books (that is,
    of my own) and mean to think about nothing but you, and you, and still
    you, for a whole week&mdash;so all will come right, I hope! <i>May</i> I take
    Wednesday? And do you say that,&mdash;hint at the possibility of that,
    because you have been reached by my own remorse at feeling that if I
    had kept my appointment <i>last</i> Saturday (but one)&mdash;Thursday would have
    been my day this past week, and this very Monday had been gained?
    Shall I not lose a day for ever unless I get Wednesday and
    Saturday?&mdash;yet ... care ... dearest&mdash;let nothing horrible happen.
</p>
<p>
    If I do not hear to the contrary to-morrow&mdash;or on Wednesday early&mdash;

    But write and bless me dearest, most dear Ba. God bless you ever&mdash;

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Monday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, February 17, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    <i>Méchant comme quatre!</i> you are, and not deserving to be let see the
    famous letter&mdash;is there any grammar in <i>that</i> concatenation, can you
    tell me, now that you are in an arch-critical humour? And remember
    (turning back to the subject) that personally she and I are strangers
    and that therefore what she writes for me is naturally scene-painting
    to be looked at from a distance, done with a masterly hand and most
    amiable intention, but quite a different thing of course from the
    intimate revelations of heart and mind which make a living thing of a
    letter. If she had sent such to me, I should not have sent it to Mr.
    Kenyon, but then, she would not have sent it to me in any case. What
    she <i>has</i> sent me might be a chapter in a book and has the life proper
    to itself, and I shall not let you try it by another standard, even if
    you wished, but you don't&mdash;for I am not so <i>bête</i> as not to understand
    how the jest crosses the serious all the way you write. Well&mdash;and Mr.
    Kenyon wants the letter the second time, not for himself, but for Mr.
    Crabb Robinson who promises to let me have a new sonnet of
    Wordsworth's in exchange for the loan, and whom I cannot refuse
    because he is an intimate friend of Miss Martineau's and once allowed
    me to read a whole packet of letters from her to him. She does not
    object (as I have read under her hand) to her letters being shown
    about in MS., notwithstanding the anathema against all printers of the
    same (which completes the extravagance of the unreason, I think) and
    people are more anxious to see them from their presumed nearness to
    annihilation. I, for my part, value letters (to talk literature) as
    the most vital part of biography, and for any rational human being to
    put his foot on the traditions of his kind in this particular class,
    does seem to me as wonderful as possible. Who would put away one of
    those multitudinous volumes, even, which stereotype Voltaire's
    wrinkles of wit&mdash;even Voltaire? I can read book after book of such
    reading&mdash;or could! And if her principle were carried out, there would
    be an end! Death would be deader from henceforth. Also it is a wrong
    selfish principle and unworthy of her whole life and profession,
    because we should all be ready to say that if the secrets of our daily
    lives and inner souls may instruct other surviving souls, let them be
    open to men hereafter, even as they are to God now. Dust to dust, and
    soul-secrets to humanity&mdash;there are natural heirs to all these things.
    Not that I do not intimately understand the shrinking back from the
    idea of publicity on any terms&mdash;not that I would not myself destroy
    papers of mine which were sacred to <i>me</i> for personal reasons&mdash;but
    then I never would call this natural weakness, virtue&mdash;nor would I, as
    a teacher of the public, announce it and attempt to justify it as an
    example to other minds and acts, I hope.
</p>
<p>
    How hard you are on the mending of stockings and the rest of it! Why
    not agree with me and like that sort of homeliness and simplicity in
    combination with such large faculty as we must admit <i>there</i>? Lord
    Bacon did a great deal of trifling besides the stuffing of the fowl
    you mention&mdash;which I did not remember: and in fact, all the great work
    done in the world, is done just by the people who know how to
    trifle&mdash;do you not think so? When a man makes a principle of 'never
    losing a moment,' he is a lost man. Great men are eager to find an
    hour, and not to avoid losing a moment. 'What are you doing' said
    somebody once (as I heard the tradition) to the beautiful Lady Oxford
    as she sate in her open carriage on the race-ground&mdash;'Only a little
    algebra,' said she. People who do a little algebra on the race-ground
    are not likely to do much of anything with ever so many hours for
    meditation. Why, you must agree with me in all this, so I shall not be
    sententious any longer. Mending stockings is not exactly the sort of
    pastime <i>I</i> should choose&mdash;who do things quite as trifling without the
    utility&mdash;and even your Seigneurie peradventure.... I stop there for
    fear of growing impertinent. The <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> is apt to
    bring down the <i>argumentum ad baculum</i>, it is as well to remember in
    time.
</p>
<p>
    For Wordsworth ... you are right in a measure and by a standard&mdash;but I
    have heard such really desecrating things of him, of his selfishness,
    his love of money, his worldly <i>cunning</i> (rather than prudence) that I
    felt a relief and gladness in the new chronicle;&mdash;and you can
    understand how <i>that</i> was. Miss Mitford's doctrine is that everything
    put into the poetry, is taken out of the man and lost utterly by him.
    Her general doctrine about poets, quite amounts to that&mdash;I do not say
    it too strongly. And knowing that such opinions are held by minds not
    feeble, it is very painful (as it would be indeed in any case) to see
    them apparently justified by royal poets like Wordsworth. Ah, but I
    know an answer&mdash;I see one in my mind!
</p>
<p>
    So again for the letters. Now ought I not to know about letters, I who
    have had so many ... from chief minds too, as society goes in England
    and America? And <i>your</i> letters began by being first to my intellect,
    before they were first to my heart. All the letters in the world are
    not like yours ... and I would trust them for that verdict with any
    jury in Europe, if they were not so far too dear! Mr. Kenyon wanted to
    make me show him your letters&mdash;I did show him the first, and resisted
    gallantly afterwards, which made him say what vexed me at the moment,
    ... 'oh&mdash;you let me see only <i>women's</i> letters,'&mdash;till I observed that
    it was a breach of confidence, except in some cases, ... and that <i>I</i>
    should complain very much, if anyone, man or woman, acted so by
    myself. But nobody in the world writes like you&mdash;not so <i>vitally</i>&mdash;and
    I have a right, if you please, to praise my letters, besides the
    reason of it which is as good.
</p>
<p>
    Ah&mdash;you made me laugh about Mr. Chorley's free speaking&mdash;and, without
    the personal knowledge, I can comprehend how it could be nothing very
    ferocious ... some 'pardonnez moi, vous êtes un ange.' The amusing
    part is that by the same post which brought me the Ambleside document,
    I heard from Miss Mitford 'that it was an admirable thing of Chorley
    to have persisted in not allowing Harriet Martineau to quarrel with
    him' ... so that there are laurels on both sides, it appears.
</p>
<p>
    And I am delighted to hear from you to-day just <i>so</i>, though I
    reproach you in turn just <i>so</i> ... because you were not 'depressed' in
    writing all this and this and this which has made me laugh&mdash;you were
    not, dearest&mdash;and you call yourself better, 'much better,' which means
    a very little perhaps, but is a golden word, let me take it as I may.
    May God bless you. Wednesday seems too near (now that this is Monday
    and you are better) to be <i>our</i> day ... perhaps it does,&mdash;and Thursday
    <i>is</i> close beside it at the worst.

<p>
    Now forgive me, dearest of all, but I must teaze you just a little,
    and entreat you, if only for the love of me, to have medical advice
    and follow it <i>without further delay</i>. I like to have recourse to
    these medical people quite as little as you can&mdash;but I am persuaded
    that it is necessary&mdash;that it is at least <i>wise</i>, for you to do so
    now, and, you see, you were 'not quite so well' again last night! So
    will you, for me? Would <i>I</i> not, if you wished it? And on Wednesday,
    yes, on Wednesday, come&mdash;that is, if coming on Wednesday should really
    be not bad for you, for you <i>must</i> do what is right and kind, and I
    doubt whether the omnibus-driving and the noises of every sort betwixt
    us, should not keep you away for a little while&mdash;I trust you to do
    what is best for both of us.
</p>
<p>
    And it is not best ... it is not good even, to talk about 'dying for
    me' ... oh, I do beseech you never to use such words. You make me feel
    as if I were choking. Also it is nonsense&mdash;because nobody puts out a
    candle for the light's sake.
</p>
<p>
    Write <i>one line</i> to me to-morrow&mdash;literally so little&mdash;just to say how
    you are. I know by the writing here, what <i>is</i>. Let me have the one
    line by the eight o'clock post to-morrow, Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
    For the rest it may be my 'goodness' or my badness, but the world
    seems to have sunk away beneath my feet and to have left only you to
    look to and hold by. Am I not to <i>feel</i>, then, any trembling of the
    hand? the least trembling?
</p>
<p>
    May God bless both of us&mdash;which is a double blessing for me
    notwithstanding my badness.
</p>
<p>
    <i>I trust you about Wednesday</i>&mdash;and if it should be wise and kind not
    to come quite so soon, we will take it out of other days and lose not
    one of them. And as for anything 'horrible' being likely to happen, do
    not think of that either,&mdash;there can be nothing horrible while you are
    not ill. So be well&mdash;try to be well&mdash;use the means and, well or ill,
    let me have the one line to-morrow ... Tuesday. I send you the foolish
    letter I wrote to-day in answer to your too long one&mdash;too long, was it
    not, as you felt? And I, the writer of the foolish one, am
    twice-foolish, and push poor 'Luria' out of sight, and refuse to
    finish my notes on him till the harm he has done shall have passed
    away. In my badness I bring false accusation, perhaps, against poor
    Luria.
</p>
<p>
    So till Wednesday&mdash;or as you shall fix otherwise.

[Post-mark, February 19, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    My sweetest, best, dearest Ba I <i>do</i> love you less, much less already,
    and adore you more, more by so much more as I see of you, think of
    you&mdash;I am yours just as much as those flowers; and you may pluck those
    flowers to pieces or put them in your breast; it is not because you so
    bless me now that you may not if you please one day&mdash;you will stop me
    here; but it is the truth and I live in it.
</p>
<p>
    I am quite well; indeed, this morning, <i>noticeably</i> well, they tell
    me, and well I mean to keep if I can.
</p>
<p>
    When I got home last evening I found this note&mdash;and I have <i>accepted</i>,
    that I might say I could also keep an engagement, if so minded, at
    Harley Street&mdash;thereby insinuating that other reasons <i>may</i> bring me
    into the neighbourhood than <i>the</i> reason&mdash;but I shall either not go
    there, or only for an hour at most. I also found a note headed
    'Strictly private and confidential'&mdash;so here it goes from my mouth to
    my heart&mdash;pleasantly proposing that I should start in a few days for
    St. Petersburg, as secretary to somebody going there on a 'mission of
    humanity'&mdash;<i>grazie tante</i>!
</p>
<p>
    Did you hear of my meeting someone at the door whom I take to have
    been one of your brothers?
</p>
<p>
    One thing vexed me in your letter&mdash;I will tell you, the praise of
    <i>my</i> letters. Now, one merit they have&mdash;in language mystical&mdash;that of
    having <i>no</i> merit. If I caught myself trying to write finely,
    graphically &amp;c. &amp;c., nay, if I found myself conscious of having in my
    own opinion, so written, all would be over! yes, over! I should be
    respecting you inordinately, paying a proper tribute to your genius,
    summoning the necessary collectedness,&mdash;plenty of all that! But the
    feeling with which I write to you, not knowing that it is
    writing,&mdash;with <i>you</i>, face and mouth and hair and eyes opposite me,
    touching me, knowing that all <i>is</i> as I say, and helping out the
    imperfect phrases from your own intuition&mdash;<i>that</i> would be gone&mdash;and
    <i>what</i> in its place? 'Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we write to
    Ambleside.' No, no, love, nor can it ever be so, nor should it ever be
    so if&mdash;even if, preserving all that intimate relation, with the
    carelessness, <i>still</i>, somehow, was obtained with no effort in the
    world, graphic writing and philosophic and what you please&mdash;for I
    <i>will</i> be&mdash;<i>would</i> be, better than my works and words with an infinite
    stock beyond what I put into convenient circulation whether in fine
    speeches fit to remember, or fine passages to quote. For the rest, I
    had meant to tell you before now, that you often put me 'in a maze'
    when you particularize letters of mine&mdash;'such an one was kind' &amp;c. I
    know, sometimes I seem to give the matter up in despair, I take out
    paper and fall thinking on you, and bless you with my whole heart and
    then begin: 'What a fine day this is?' I distinctly remember having
    done that repeatedly&mdash;but the converse is not true by any means, that
    (when the expression may happen to fall more consentaneously to the
    mind's motion) that less is felt, oh no! But the particular thought at
    the time has not been of the <i>insufficiency</i> of expression, as in the
    other instance.
</p>
<p>
    Now I will leave off&mdash;to begin elsewhere&mdash;for I am always with you,
    beloved, best beloved! Now you will write? And walk much, and sleep
    more? Bless you, dearest&mdash;ever&mdash;

<p>
    Best and kindest of all that ever were to be loved in dreams, and
    wondered at and loved out of them, you are indeed! I cannot make you
    feel how I felt that night when I knew that to save me an anxious
    thought you had come so far so late&mdash;it was almost too much to feel,
    and <i>is</i> too much to speak. So let it pass. You will never act so
    again, ever dearest&mdash;you shall not. If the post sins, why leave the
    sin to the post; and I will remember for the future, will be ready to
    remember, how postmen are fallible and how you live at the end of a
    lane&mdash;and not be uneasy about a silence if there should be one
    unaccounted for. For the Tuesday coming, I shall remember that
    too&mdash;who could forget it?... I put it in the niche of the wall, one
    golden lamp more of your giving, to throw light purely down to the end
    of my life&mdash;I do thank you. And the truth is, I <i>should</i> have been in
    a panic, had there been no letter that evening&mdash;I was frightened the
    day before, then reasoned the fears back and waited: and if there had
    been no letter after all&mdash;. But you are supernaturally good and kind.
    How can I ever 'return' as people say (as they might say in their
    ledgers) ... any of it all? How indeed can I who have not even a heart
    left of my own, to love you with?
</p>
<p>
    I quite trust to your promise in respect to the medical advice, if
    walking and rest from work do not prevent at once the recurrence of
    those sensations&mdash;it was a promise, remember. And you will tell me the
    very truth of how you are&mdash;and you will try the music, and not be
    nervous, dearest. Would not <i>riding</i> be good for you&mdash;consider. And
    why should you be 'alone' when your sister is in the house? How I keep
    thinking of you all day&mdash;you cannot really be alone with so many
    thoughts ... such swarms of thoughts, if you could but see them,
    drones and bees together!

    George came in from Westminster Hall after we parted yesterday and
    said that he had talked with the junior counsel of the wretched
    plaintiffs in the Ferrers case, and that the belief was in the mother
    being implicated, although not from the beginning. It was believed too
    that the miserable girl had herself taken step after step into the
    mire, involved herself gradually, the first guilt being an
    extravagance in personal expenses, which she lied and lied to account
    for in the face of her family. 'Such a respectable family,' said
    George, 'the grandfather in court looking venerable, and everyone
    indignant upon being so disgraced by her!' But for the respectability
    in the best sense, I do not quite see. That all those people should
    acquiesce in the indecency (according to every standard of English
    manners in any class of society) of thrusting the personal expenses of
    a member of their family on Lord Ferrers, she still bearing their
    name&mdash;and in those peculiar circumstances of her supposed position
    too&mdash;where is the respectability? And they are furious with her, which
    is not to be wondered at after all. Her counsel had an interview with
    her previous to the trial, to satisfy themselves of her good faith,
    and she was quite resolute and earnest, persisting in every statement.
    On the coming out of the anonymous letters, Fitzroy Kelly said to the
    juniors that if anyone could suggest a means of explanation, he would
    be eager to carry forward the case, ... but for him he saw no way of
    escaping from the fact of the guilt of their client. Not a voice could
    speak for her. So George was told. There is no ground for a
    prosecution for a conspiracy, he says, but she is open to the charge
    for <i>forgery</i>, of course, and to the dreadful consequences, though it
    is not considered at all likely that Lord Ferrers could wish to
    disturb her beyond the ruin she has brought on her own life.

<p>
    Think of Miss Mitford's growing quite cold about Mr. Chorley who has
    spent two days with her lately, and of her saying in a letter to me
    this morning that he is very much changed and grown to be 'a
    presumptuous coxcomb.' He has displeased her in some way&mdash;that is
    clear. What changes there are in the world.
</p>
<p>
    Should I ever change to <i>you</i>, do you think, ... even if you came to
    'love me less'&mdash;not that I meant to reproach you with that
    possibility. May God bless you, dear dearest. It is another miracle
    (beside the many) that I get nearer to the mountains yet still they
    seem more blue. Is not <i>that</i> strange?

</p>
<p>
    And I offended you by praising your letters&mdash;or rather <i>mine</i>, if you
    please&mdash;as if I had not the right! Still, you shall not, shall not
    fancy that I meant to praise them in the way you seem to think&mdash;by
    calling them 'graphic,' 'philosophic,'&mdash;why, did I ever use such
    words? I agree with you that if I could play critic upon your letters,
    it would be an end!&mdash;but no, no ... I did not, for a moment. In what I
    said I went back to my first impressions&mdash;and they were <i>vital</i>
    letters, I said&mdash;which was the résumé of my thoughts upon the early
    ones you sent me, because I felt your letters to be <i>you</i> from the
    very first, and I began, from the beginning, to read every one several
    times over. Nobody, I felt, nobody of all these writers, did write as
    you did. Well!&mdash;and had I not a right to say <i>that</i> now at last, and
    was it not natural to say just <i>that</i>, when I was talking of other
    people's letters and how it had grown almost impossible for me to read
    them; and do I deserve to be scolded? No indeed.
</p>
<p>
    And if I had the misfortune to think now, when you say it is a fine
    day, that <i>that</i> is said in more music than it could be said in by
    another&mdash;where is the sin against <i>you</i>, I should like to ask. It is
    yourself who is the critic, I think, after all. But over all the
    brine, I hold my letters&mdash;just as Camoens did his poem. They are <i>best
    to me</i>&mdash;and they are <i>best</i>. I knew what <i>they</i> were, before I knew
    what <i>you</i> were&mdash;all of you. And I like to think that I never fancied
    anyone on a level with you, even in a letter.
</p>
<p>
    What makes you take them to be so bad, I suppose, is just feeling in
    them how near we are. <i>You say that!</i>&mdash;not I.
</p>
<p>
    Bad or good, you <i>are</i> better&mdash;yes, 'better than the works and
    words'!&mdash;though it was very shameful of you to insinuate that I talked
    of fine speeches and passages and graphical and philosophical
    sentences, as if I had proposed a publication of 'Elegant Extracts'
    from your letters. See what blasphemy one falls into through a
    beginning of light speech! It is wiser to talk of St. Petersburg; for
    all Voltaire's ... '<i>ne disons pas de mal de Nicolas</i>.'
</p>
<p>
    Wiser&mdash;because you will not go. If you were going ... well!&mdash;but there
    is no danger&mdash;it would not do you good to go, I am so happy this time
    as to be able to think&mdash;and your 'mission of humanity' lies
    nearer&mdash;'strictly private and confidential'? but not in Harley
    Street&mdash;so if you go <i>there</i>, dearest, keep to the 'one hour' and do
    not suffer yourself to be tired and stunned in those hot rooms and
    made unwell again&mdash;it is plain that you cannot bear that sort of
    excitement. For Mr. Kenyon's note, ... it was a great temptation to
    make a day of Friday&mdash;but I resist both for Monday's sake and for
    yours, because it seems to me safer not to hurry you from one house to
    another till you are tired completely. I shall think of you so much
    the nearer for Mr. Kenyon's note&mdash;which is something gained. In the
    meanwhile you are better, which is everything, or seems so. Ever
    dearest, do you remember what it is to me that you should be better,
    and keep from being worse again&mdash;I mean, of course, <i>try</i> to keep from
    being worse&mdash;be wise ... and do not stay long in those hot Harley
    Street rooms. Ah&mdash;now you will think that I am afraid of the
    unicorns!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    Through your being ill the other day I forgot, and afterwards went on
    forgetting, to speak of and to return the ballad&mdash;which is delightful;
    I have an unspeakable delight in those suggestive ballads, which seem
    to make you touch with the end of your finger the full warm life of
    other times ... so near they bring you, yet so suddenly all passes in
    them. Certainly there is a likeness to your Duchess&mdash;it is a curious
    crossing. And does it not strike you that a verse or two must be
    wanting in the ballad&mdash;there is a gap, I fancy.
</p>
<p>
    Tell Mr. Kenyon (if he enquires) that you come here on Monday instead
    of Saturday&mdash;and if you can help it, do not mention Wednesday&mdash;it will
    be as well, not. You met Alfred at the door&mdash;he came up to me
    afterwards and observed that 'at last he had seen you!' 'Virgilium
    tantum vidi!'
</p>
<p>
    As to the thing which you try to say in the first page of this letter,
    and which you 'stop' yourself in saying ... <i>I</i> need not stop you in
    it....
</p>
<p>
    And now there is no time, if I am to sleep to-night. May God bless
    you, dearest, dearest.

<p>
    I must be your own while He blesses <i>me</i>.

    Here is my Ba's dearest <i>first</i> letter come four hours after the
    second, with '<i>Mis-sent to Mitcham</i>' written on its face as a
    reason,&mdash;one more proof of the negligence of somebody! But I <i>do</i> have
    it at last&mdash;what should I say? what do you expect me to say? And the
    first note seemed quite as much too kind as usual!
</p>
<p>
    Let me write to-morrow, sweet? I am quite well and sure to mind all
    you bid me. I shall do no more than look in at that place (they are
    the cousins of a really good friend of mine, Dr. White&mdash;I go for
    <i>him</i>) if even that&mdash;for to-morrow night I must go out again, I
    fear&mdash;to pay the ordinary compliment for an invitation to the R.S.'s
    <i>soirée</i> at Lord Northampton's. And then comes Monday&mdash;and to-night
    any unicorn I may see I will not find myself at liberty to catch.
    (N.B.&mdash;should you meditate really an addition to the 'Elegant
    Extracts'&mdash;mind this last joke is none of mine but my father's; when
    walking with me when a child, I remember, he bade a little urchin we
    found fishing with a stick and a string for sticklebacks in a
    ditch&mdash;'to mind that he brought any sturgeon he might catch to the
    king'&mdash;he having a claim on such a prize, by courtesy if not right).
</p>
<p>
    As for Chorley, he is neither the one nor the other of those ugly
    things. One remembers Regan's 'Oh Heaven&mdash;so you will rail at <i>me</i>,
    when you are in the mood.' But what a want of self-respect such
    judgments argue, or rather, want of knowledge what true self-respect
    is: 'So I believed yesterday, and <i>so</i> now&mdash;and yet am neither hasty,
    nor inapprehensive, nor malevolent'&mdash;what then?
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;But I will say more of my mind&mdash;(not of that)&mdash;to-morrow, for time

<p>
    As my sisters did not dine at home yesterday and I see nobody else in
    the evening, I never heard till just now and <i>from Papa himself</i>, that
    'George was invited to meet Mr. Browning and Mr. Procter.' How
    surprised you will be. It must have been a sudden thought of Mr.
    Kenyon's.
</p>
<p>
    And I have been thinking, thinking since last night that I wrote you
    then a letter all but ... insolent ... which, do you know, I feel half
    ashamed to look back upon this morning&mdash;particularly what I wrote
    about 'missions of humanity'&mdash;now was it not insolent of me to write
    so? If I could take my letter again I would dip it into Lethe between
    the lilies, instead of the post office:&mdash;but I can't&mdash;so if you
    wondered, you must forget as far as possible, and understand how it
    was, and that I was in brimming spirits when I wrote, from two causes
    ... first, because I had your letter which was a pure goodness of
    yours, and secondly because you were 'noticeably' better you said, or
    'noticeably well' rather, to mind my quotations. So I wrote what I
    wrote, and gave it to Arabel when she came in at midnight, to give it
    to Henrietta who goes out before eight in the morning and often takes
    charge of my letters, and it was too late, at the earliest this
    morning, to feel a little ashamed. Miss Thomson told me that she had
    determined to change the type of the few pages of her letterpress
    which had been touched, and that therefore Mr. Burges's revisions of
    my translations should be revised back again. She appears to be a very
    acute person, full of quick perceptions&mdash;naturally quick, and
    carefully trained&mdash;a little over anxious perhaps about mental lights,
    and opening her eyes still more than she sees, which is a common fault
    of clever people, if one must call it a fault. I like her, and she is
    kind and cordial. Will she ask you to help her book with a translation
    or two, I wonder. Perhaps&mdash;if the courage should come. Dearest, how I
    shall think of you this evening, and how near you will seem, not to be
    here. I had a letter from Mr. Mathews the other day, and smiled to
    read in it just what I had expected, that he immediately sent Landor's
    verses on you to a <i>few editors</i>, friends of his, in order to their
    communication to the public. He received my apology for myself with
    the utmost graciousness. A kind good man he is.
</p>
<p>
    After all, do you know, I am a little vexed that I should have even
    <i>seemed</i> to do wrong in my speech about the letters. It must have been
    wrong, if it seemed so to you, I fancy now. Only I really did no more
    mean to try your letters ... mine ... such as they are to me now, by
    the common critical measure, than the shepherds praised the pure tenor
    of the angels who sang 'Peace upon earth' to them. It was enough that
    they knew it for angels' singing. So do <i>you</i> forgive me, beloved, and
    put away from you the thought that I have let in between us any
    miserable stuff 'de métier,' which I hate as you hate. And I will not
    say any more about it, not to run into more imprudences of mischief.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand I warn you against saying again what you began to
    say yesterday and stopped. Do not try it again. What may be quite good
    sense from me, is from <i>you</i> very much the reverse, and pray observe
    that difference. Or did you think that I was making my own road clear
    in the the thing I said about&mdash;'jilts'? No, you did not. Yet I am
    ready to repeat of myself as of others, that if I ceased to love you,
    I certainly would act out the whole consequence&mdash;but <i>that</i> is an
    impossible 'if' to my nature, supposing the conditions of it otherwise
    to be probable. I never loved anyone much and ceased to love that
    person. Ask every friend of mine, if I am given to change even in
    friendship! <i>And to you...!</i> Ah, but you never think of such a thing
    seriously&mdash;and you are conscious that you did not say it very sagely.
    You and I are in different positions. Now let me tell you an apologue
    in exchange for your Wednesday's stories which I liked so, and mine
    perhaps may make you 'a little wiser'&mdash;who knows?
</p>
<p>
    It befell that there stood in hall a bold baron, and out he spake to
    one of his serfs ... 'Come thou; and take this baton of my baronie,
    and give me instead thereof that sprig of hawthorn thou holdest in
    thine hand.' Now the hawthorn-bough was no larger a thing than might
    be carried by a wood-pigeon to the nest, when she flieth low, and the
    baronial baton was covered with fine gold, and the serf, turning it
    in his hands, marvelled greatly.
</p>
<p>
    And he answered and said, 'Let not my lord be in haste, nor jest with
    his servant. Is it verily his will that I should keep his golden
    baton? Let him speak again&mdash;lest it repent him of his gift.'
</p>
<p>
    And the baron spake again that it was his will. 'And I'&mdash;he said once
    again&mdash;'shall it be lawful for me to keep this sprig of hawthorn, and
    will it not repent thee of thy gift?'
</p>
<p>
    Then all the servants who stood in hall, laughed, and the serf's hands
    trembled till they dropped the baton into the rushes, knowing that his
    lord did but jest....
</p>
<p>
    Which mine did not. Only, <i>de te fabula narratur</i> up to a point.
</p>
<p>
    And I have your letter. 'What did I expect?' Why I expected just
    <i>that</i>, a letter in turn. Also I am graciously pleased (yes, and very
    much pleased!) to '<i>let</i> you write to-morrow.' How you spoil me with
    goodness, which makes one 'insolent' as I was saying, now and then.
</p>
<p>
    The worst is, that I write 'too kind' letters&mdash;I!&mdash;and what does that
    criticism mean, pray? It reminds me, at least, of ... now I will tell
    you what it reminds me of.
</p>
<p>
    A few days ago Henrietta said to me that she was quite uncomfortable.
    She had written to somebody a not kind enough letter, she thought, and
    it might be taken ill. 'Are <i>you</i> ever uncomfortable, Ba, after you
    have sent letters to the post?' she asked me.
</p>
<p>
    'Yes,' I said, 'sometimes, but from a reason just the very reverse of
    your reason, <i>my</i> letters, when they get into the post, seem too
    kind,&mdash;rather.' And my sisters laughed ... laughed.
</p>
<p>
    But if <i>you</i> think so beside, I must seriously set to work, you see,
    to correct that flagrant fault, and shall do better in time <i>dis
    faventibus</i>, though it will be difficult.

    Mr. Kenyon's dinner is a riddle which I cannot read. <i>You</i> are
    invited to meet Miss Thomson and Mr. Bayley and '<i>no one else</i>.'
    George is invited to meet Mr. Browning and Mr. Procter and '<i>no one
    else</i>'&mdash;just those words. The '<i>absolu</i>' (do you remember Balzac's
    beautiful story?) is just <i>you</i> and 'no one else,' the other elements
    being mere uncertainties, shifting while one looks for them.
</p>
<p>
    Am I not writing nonsense to-night? I am not 'too <i>wise</i>' in any case,
    which is some comfort. It puts one in spirits to hear of your being
    'well,' ever and ever dearest. Keep so for <i>me</i>. May God bless you
    hour by hour. In every one of mine I am your own

<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, February 23, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    So all was altered, my love&mdash;and, instead of Miss T. and the other
    friend, I had your brother and Procter&mdash;to my great pleasure. After, I
    went to that place, and soon got away, and am very well this morning
    in the sunshine; which I feel with you, do I not? Yesterday after
    dinner we spoke of Mrs. Jameson, and, as my wont is&mdash;(Here your letter
    reaches me&mdash;let me finish this sentence now I have finished kissing
    you, dearest beyond all dearness&mdash;My own heart's Ba!)&mdash;oh, as I am
    used, I left the talking to go on by itself, with the thought busied
    elsewhere, till at last my own voice startled me for I heard my tongue
    utter 'Miss Barrett ... that is, Mrs. Jameson says' ... or 'does ...
    or does not.' I forget which! And if anybody noticed the <i>gaucherie</i>
    it must have been just your brother!
</p>
<p>
    Now to these letters! I do solemnly, unaffectedly wonder how you can
    put so much pure felicity into an envelope so as that I shall get it
    as from the fount head. This to-day, those yesterday&mdash;there is, I see,
    and know, thus much goodness in line after line, goodness to be
    scientifically appreciated, <i>proved there</i>&mdash;but over and above, is it
    in the writing, the dots and traces, the seal, the paper&mdash;here does
    the subtle charm lie beyond all rational accounting for? The other day
    I stumbled on a quotation from J. Baptista Porta&mdash;wherein he avers
    that any musical instrument made out of wood possessed of medicinal
    properties retains, being put to use, such virtues undiminished,&mdash;and
    that, for instance, a sick man to whom you should pipe on a pipe of
    elder-tree would so receive all the advantage derivable from a
    decoction of its berries. From whence, by a parity of reasoning, I may
    discover, I think, that the very ink and paper were&mdash;ah, what were
    they? Curious thinking won't do for me and the wise head which is
    mine, so I will lie and rest in my ignorance of content and understand
    that without any magic at all you simply wish to make one
    person&mdash;which of your free goodness proves to be your R.B.&mdash;to make me
    supremely happy, and that you have your wish&mdash;you <i>do</i> bless me! More
    and more, for the old treasure is piled undiminished and still the new
    comes glittering in. Dear, dear heart of my heart, life of my life,
    <i>will this last</i>, let <i>me</i> begin to ask? Can it be meant I shall live
    this to the end? Then, dearest, care also for the life beyond, and put
    in my mind how to testify here that I have felt, if I could not
    deserve that a gift beyond all gifts! I hope to work hard, to prove I
    do feel, as I say&mdash;it would be terrible to accomplish nothing now.
</p>
<p>
    With which conviction&mdash;renewed conviction time by time, of your
    extravagance of kindness to me unworthy,&mdash;will it seem
    characteristically consistent when I pray you not to begin frightening
    me, all the same, with threats of writing <i>less</i> kindly? That must not
    be, love, for <i>your</i> sake now&mdash;if you had not thrown open those
    windows of heaven I should have no more imagined than that Syrian lord
    on whom the King leaned 'how such things might be'&mdash;but, once their
    influence showered, I should know, too soon and easily, if they shut
    up again! You have committed your dear, dearest self to that course of
    blessing, and blessing on, on, for ever&mdash;so let all be as it is, pray,
    <i>pray</i>!
</p>
<p>
    No&mdash;not <i>all</i>. No more, ever, of that strange
    suspicion&mdash;'insolent'&mdash;oh, what a word!&mdash;nor suppose I shall
    particularly wonder at its being fancied applicable to <i>that</i>, of all
    other passages of your letter! It is quite as reasonable to suspect
    the existence of such a quality <i>there</i> as elsewhere: how <i>can</i> such a
    thing, <i>could</i> such a thing come from you to me? But, dear Ba, <i>do</i>
    you know me better! <i>Do</i> feel that I know you, I am bold to believe,
    and that if you were to run at me with a pointed spear I should be
    sure it was a golden sanative, Machaon's touch, for my entire good,
    that I was opening my heart to receive! As for words, written or
    spoken&mdash;I, who sin forty times in a day by light words, and untrue to
    the thought, I am certainly not used to be easily offended by other
    peoples' words, people in the world. But <i>your</i> words! And about the
    'mission'; if it had not been a thing to jest at, I should not have
    begun, as I did&mdash;as you felt I did. I know now, what I only suspected
    then, and will tell you all the matter on Monday if you care to hear.
    The 'humanity' however, would have been unquestionable if I had chosen
    to exercise it towards the poor weak incapable creature that wants
    <i>somebody</i>, and urgently, I can well believe.
</p>
<p>
    As for your apologue, it is naught&mdash;as you felt, and so broke off&mdash;for
    the baron knew well enough it was a spray of the magical tree which
    once planted in his domain would shoot up, and out, and all round, and
    be glorious with leaves and musical with birds' nests, and a fairy
    safeguard and blessing thenceforward and for ever, when the foolish
    baton had been broken into ounces of gold, even if gold it <i>were</i>, and
    spent and vanished: for, he said, such gold lies in the highway, men
    pick it up, more of it or less; but this one slip of the flowering
    tree is all of it on this side Paradise. Whereon he laid it to his
    heart and was happy&mdash;in spite of his disastrous chase the night
    before, when so far from catching an unicorn, he saw not even a
    respectable prize-heifer, worth the oil-cake and rape-seed it had
    doubtless cost to rear her&mdash;'insolence!'
</p>
<p>
    I found no opportunity of speaking to Mr. K. about Monday, but nothing
    was said of last Wednesday, and he must know I did not go yesterday.
    So, Monday is laughing in sunshine surely! Bless you, my sweetest. I
    love you with my whole heart; ever shall love you.

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, February 24, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ever dearest, it is only when you go away, when you are quite gone,
    out of the house and the street, that I get up and think properly, and
    with the right gratitude of your flowers. Such beautiful flowers you
    brought me this time too! looking like summer itself, and smelling!
    Doing the 'honour due' to the flowers, makes your presence a little
    longer with me, the sun shines back over the hill just by that time,
    and then drops, till the next letter.
</p>
<p>
    If I had had the letter on Saturday as ought to have been, no, I could
    <i>not</i> have answered it so that you should have my answer on
    Sunday&mdash;no, I should still have had to write first.
</p>
<p>
    Now you understand that I do not object to the writing first, but only
    to the hearing second. I would rather write than not&mdash;I! But to be
    written to is the chief gladness of course; and with all you say of
    liking to have my letters (which I like to hear quite enough indeed)
    you cannot pretend to think that <i>yours</i> are not more to <i>me</i>, most to
    <i>me</i>! Ask my guardian-angel and hear what he says! Yours will look
    another way for shame of measuring joys with him! Because as I have
    said before, and as he says now, you are all to me, all the light, all
    the life; I am living for you now. And before I knew you, what was I
    and where? What was the world to me, do you think? and the meaning of
    life? And now, when you come and go, and write and do not write, all
    the hours are chequered accordingly in so many squares of white and
    black, as if for playing at fox and goose ... only there is no fox,
    and I will not agree to be goose for one ... <i>that</i> is <i>you</i> perhaps,
    for being 'too easily' satisfied.
</p>
<p>
    So my claim is that you are more to me than I can be to you at any
    rate. Mr. Fox said on Sunday that I was a 'religious hermit' who wrote
    'poems which ought to be read in a Gothic alcove'; and religious
    hermits, when they care to see visions, do it better, they all say,
    through fasting and flagellation and seclusion in dark places. St.
    Theresa, for instance, saw a clearer glory by such means, than your
    Sir Moses Montefiore through his hundred-guinea telescope. Think then,
    how every shadow of my life has helped to throw out into brighter,
    fuller significance, the light which comes to me from you ... think
    how it is the one light, seen without distractions.
</p>
<p>
    <i>I</i> was thinking the other day that certainly and after all (or rather
    before all) I had loved you all my life unawares, that is, the idea of
    you. Women begin for the most part, (if ever so very little given to
    reverie) by meaning, in an aside to themselves, to love such and such
    an ideal, seen sometimes in a dream and sometimes in a book, and
    forswearing their ancient faith as the years creep on. I say a book,
    because I remember a friend of mine who looked everywhere for the
    original of Mr. Ward's 'Tremaine,' because nothing would do for <i>her</i>,
    she insisted, except just <i>that</i> excess of so-called refinement, with
    the book-knowledge and the conventional manners, (<i>loue qui peut</i>,
    Tremaine), and ended by marrying a lieutenant in the Navy who could
    not spell. Such things happen every day, and cannot be otherwise, say
    the wise:&mdash;and <i>this</i> being otherwise with <i>me</i> is miraculous
    compensation for the trials of many years, though such abundant,
    overabundant compensation, that I cannot help fearing it is too much,
    as I know that you are too good and too high for me, and that by the
    degree in which I am raised up you are let down, for us two to find a
    level to meet on. One's ideal must be above one, as a matter of
    course, you know. It is as far as one can reach with one's eyes
    (soul-eyes), not reach to touch. And here is mine ... shall I tell
    you? ... even to the visible outward sign of the black hair and the
    complexion (why you might ask my sisters!) yet I would not tell you,
    if I could not tell you afterwards that, if it had been red hair
    quite, it had been the same thing, only I prove the coincidence out
    fully and make you smile half.
</p>
<p>
    Yet indeed I did not fancy that I was to love <i>you</i> when you came to
    see me&mdash;no indeed ... any more than I did your caring on your side. My
    ambition when we began our correspondence, was simply that you should
    forget I was a woman (being weary and <i>blasée</i> of the empty written
    gallantries, of which I have had my share and all the more perhaps
    from my peculiar position which made them so without consequence),
    that you should forget <i>that</i> and let us be friends, and consent to
    teach me what you knew better than I, in art and human nature, and
    give me your sympathy in the meanwhile. I am a great hero-worshipper
    and had admired your poetry for years, and to feel that you liked to
    write to me and be written to was a pleasure and a pride, as I used
    to tell you I am sure, and then your letters were not like other
    letters, as I must not tell you again. Also you <i>influenced</i> me, in a
    way in which no one else did. For instance, by two or three half words
    you made me see you, and other people had delivered orations on the
    same subject quite without effect. I surprised everybody in this house
    by consenting to see you. Then, when you came, you never went away. I
    mean I had a sense of your presence constantly. Yes ... and to prove
    how free that feeling was from the remotest presentiment of what has
    occurred, I said to Papa in my unconsciousness the next morning ...
    'it is most extraordinary how the idea of Mr. Browning does beset
    me&mdash;I suppose it is not being used to see strangers, in some
    degree&mdash;but it haunts me ... it is a persecution.' On which he smiled
    and said that 'it was not grateful to my friend to use such a word.'
    When the letter came....
</p>
<p>
    Do you know that all that time I was frightened of you? frightened in
    this way. I felt as if you had a power over me and meant to use it,
    and that I could not breathe or speak very differently from what you
    chose to make me. As to my thoughts, I had it in my head somehow that
    you read <i>them</i> as you read the newspaper&mdash;examined them, and fastened
    them down writhing under your long entomological pins&mdash;ah, do you
    remember the entomology of it all?
</p>
<p>
    But the power was used upon <i>me</i>&mdash;and I never doubted that you had
    mistaken your own mind, the strongest of us having some exceptional
    weakness. Turning the wonder round in all lights, I came to what you
    admitted yesterday ... yes, I saw <i>that</i> very early ... that you had
    come here with the intention of trying to love whomever you should
    find, ... and also that what I had said about exaggerating the amount
    of what I could be to you, had just operated in making you more
    determined to justify your own presentiment in the face of mine.
    Well&mdash;and if that last clause was true a little, too ... why should I
    be sorry now ... and why should you have fancied for a moment, that
    the first could make me sorry. At first and when I did not believe
    that you really loved me, when I thought you deceived yourself,
    <i>then</i>, it was different. But now ... now ... when I see and believe
    your attachment for me, do you think that any cause in the world
    (except what diminished it) could render it less a source of joy to
    me? I mean as far as I myself am considered. Now if you ever fancy
    that I am <i>vain</i> of your love for me, you will be unjust, remember. If
    it were less dear, and less above me, I might be vain perhaps. But I
    may say <i>before</i> God and you, that of all the events of my life,
    inclusive of its afflictions, nothing has humbled me so much as your
    love. Right or wrong it may be, but true it <i>is</i>, and I tell you. Your
    love has been to me like God's own love, which makes the receivers of
    it kneelers.
</p>
<p>
    Why all this should be written, I do not know&mdash;but you set me thinking
    yesterday in that backward line, which I lean back to very often, and
    for once, as you made me write directly, why I wrote, as my thoughts
    went, that way.
</p>
<p>
    Say how you are, beloved&mdash;and do not brood over that 'Soul's Tragedy,'
    which I wish I had here with 'Luria,' because, so, you should not see
    it for a month at least. And take exercise and keep well&mdash;and remember
    how many letters I must have before Saturday. May God bless you. Do
    you want to hear me say
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I cannot love you less...?
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em"><i>That</i> is a doubtful phrase. And
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I cannot love you more
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">is doubtful too, for reasons I could give. More or less, I really love
    you, but it does not sound right, even <i>so</i>, does it? I know what it
    ought to be, and will put it into the 'seal' and the 'paper' with the
    ineffable other things.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Once you were pleased to say, my own Ba, that 'I made you do as I
    would.' I am quite sure, you make me <i>speak</i> as you would, and not at
    all as I mean&mdash;and for one instance, I never surely spoke anything
    half so untrue as that 'I came with the intention of loving whomever I
    should find'&mdash;No! wreathed shells and hollows in ruins, and roofs of
    caves may transform a voice wonderfully, make more of it or less, or
    so change it as to almost alter, but turn a 'no' into a 'yes' can no
    echo (except the Irish one), and I said 'no' to such a charge, and
    still say 'no.' I <i>did</i> have a presentiment&mdash;and though it is hardly
    possible for me to look back on it now without lending it the true
    colours given to it by the event, yet I <i>can</i> put them aside, if I
    please, and remember that I not merely hoped it would not be so (<i>not</i>
    that the effect I expected to be produced would be <i>less</i> than in
    anticipation, certainly I did not hope <i>that</i>, but that it would range
    itself with the old feelings of simple reverence and sympathy and
    friendship, that I should love you as much as I supposed I <i>could</i>
    love, and no more) but in the confidence that nothing could occur to
    divert me from my intended way of life, I made&mdash;went on making
    arrangements to return to Italy. You know&mdash;did I not tell you&mdash;I
    wished to see you before I returned? And I had heard of you just so
    much as seemed to make it impossible such a relation could ever exist.
    I know very well, if you choose to refer to my letters you may easily
    bring them to bear a sense in parts, more agreeable to your own theory
    than to mine, the true one&mdash;but that was instinct,
    Providence&mdash;anything rather than foresight. Now I will convince you!
    yourself have noticed the difference between the <i>letters</i> and the
    <i>writer</i>; the greater 'distance of the latter from you,' why was that?
    Why, if not because the conduct <i>began</i> with <i>him</i>, with one who had
    now seen you&mdash;was no continuation of the conduct, as influenced by the
    feeling, of the letters&mdash;else, they, if <i>near</i>, should have enabled
    him, if but in the natural course of time and with increase of
    familiarity, to become <i>nearer</i>&mdash;but it was not so! The letters began
    by loving you after their way&mdash;but what a world-wide difference
    between <i>that</i> love and the true, the love from seeing and hearing and
    feeling, since you make me resolve, what now lies blended so
    harmoniously, into its component parts. Oh, I know what is old from
    what is new, and how chrystals may surround and glorify other vessels
    meant for ordinary service than Lord N's! But I <i>don't</i> know that
    handling may not snap them off, some of the more delicate ones; and if
    you let me, love, I will not again, ever again, consider how it came
    and whence, and when, so curiously, so pryingly, but believe that it
    was always so, and that it all came at once, all the same; the more
    unlikelinesses the better, for they set off the better the truth of
    truths that here, ('how begot? how nourished?')&mdash;here is the whole
    wondrous Ba filling my whole heart and soul; and over-filling it,
    because she is in all the world, too, where I look, where I fancy. At
    the same time, because all is so wondrous and so sweet, do you think
    that it would be <i>so</i> difficult for me to analyse it, and give causes
    to the effects in sufficiently numerous instances, even to 'justify my
    presentiment?' Ah, dear, dearest Ba, I could, could indeed, could
    account for all, or enough! But you are unconscious, I do believe, of
    your power, and the knowledge of it would be no added grace, perhaps!
    So let us go on&mdash;taking a lesson out of the world's book in a
    different sense. You shall think I love you for&mdash;(tell me, you must,
    what for) while in my secret heart I know what my 'mission of
    humanity' means, and what telescopic and microscopic views it procures
    me. Enough&mdash;Wait, one word about the 'too kind letters'&mdash;could not the
    same Montefiore understand that though he deserved not one of his
    thousand guineas, yet that he is in disgrace if they bate him of his
    next gift by merely <i>ten</i>? It <i>is</i> all too kind&mdash;but I shall feel the
    diminishing of the kindness, be very sure! Of that there is, however,
    not too alarming a sign in this dearest, because last of all&mdash;dearest
    letter of all&mdash;till the next! I looked yesterday over the 'Tragedy,'
    and think it will do after all. I will bring one part at least next
    time, and 'Luria' take away, if you let me, so all will be off my
    mind, and April and May be the welcomer? Don't think I am going to
    take any extraordinary pains. There are some things in the 'Tragedy' I
    should like to preserve and print now, leaving the future to spring
    as it likes, in any direction, and these half-dead, half-alive works

<p>
    Yet one thing will fetter it worse, only one thing&mdash;if <i>you</i>, in any
    respect, stay behind? You that in all else help me and will help me,
    beyond words&mdash;beyond dreams&mdash;if, because I find you, your own works
    <i>stop</i>&mdash;'then comes the Selah and the voice is hushed.' Oh, no, no,
    dearest, <i>so</i> would the help cease to be help&mdash;the joy to be joy, Ba
    herself to be <i>quite</i> Ba, and my own Siren singing song for song. Dear
    love, will that be kind, and right, and like the rest? Write and
    promise that all shall be resumed, the romance-poem chiefly, and I
    will try and feel more yours than ever now. Am I not with you in the
    world, proud of you&mdash;and <i>vain</i>, too, very likely, which is all the
    sweeter if it is a sin as you teach me. Indeed dearest, I have set my
    heart on your fulfilling your mission&mdash;my heart is on it! Bless you,

    I confess that while I was writing those words I had a thought that
    they were not quite yours as you said them. Still it comes to
    something in their likeness, but we will not talk of it and break off
    the chrystals&mdash;they <i>are</i> so brittle, then? do you know <i>that</i> by an
    'instinct.' But I agree that it is best not to talk&mdash;I 'gave it up' as
    a riddle long ago. Let there be 'analysis' even, and it will not be
    solution. I have my own thoughts of course, and you have yours, and
    the worst is that a third person looking down on us from some
    snow-capped height, and free from personal influences, would have
    <i>his</i> thoughts too, and <i>he</i> would think that if you had been
    reasonable as usual you would have gone to Italy. I have by heart (or
    by head at least) what the third person would think. The third person
    thundered to me in an abstraction for ever so long, and at intervals I
    hear him still, only you shall not to-day, because he talks 'damnable
    iterations' and teazes you. Nay, the first person is teazing you now
    perhaps, without going any further, and yet I must go a little
    further, just to say (after accepting all possible unlikelinesses and
    miracles, because everything was miraculous and impossible) that it
    was agreed between us long since that you did not love me for
    anything&mdash;your having no reason for it is the only way of your not
    seeming unreasonable. Also <i>for my own sake</i>. I like it to be so&mdash;I
    cannot have peace with the least change from it. Dearest, take the
    baron's hawthorn bough which, in spite of his fine dream of it is dead
    since the other day, and so much the worse than when I despised it
    last&mdash;take that dead stick and push it upright into the sand as the
    tide rises, and the whole blue sea draws up its glittering breadth and
    length towards and around it. But what then? What does <i>that prove</i>?
    ... as the philosopher said of the poem. So we ought not to talk of
    such things; and we get warned off even in the accidental
    illustrations taken up to light us. Still, the stick certainly did not
    draw the sea.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest and best you were yesterday, to write me the little note! You
    are better than the imaginations of my heart, and <i>they</i>, as far as
    they relate to you (not further) are <i>not</i> desperately wicked, I
    think. I always expect the kindest things from you, and you always are
    doing some kindness beyond what is expected, and this is a miracle
    too, like the rest, now isn't it? When the knock came last night, I
    knew it was your letter, and not another's. Just another little leaf
    of my Koran! How I thank you ... thank you! If I write too kind
    letters, as you say, why they may be too kind for me to send, but not
    for you to receive; and I suppose I think more of you than of me,
    which accounts for my writing them, accounts and justifies. And <i>that</i>
    is my reflection not now for the first time. For we break rules very
    often&mdash;as that exegetical third person might expound to you clearly
    out of the ninety-sixth volume of the 'Code of Conventions,' only you
    are not like another, nor have you been to me like another&mdash;you began
    with most improvident and (will you let me say?) <i>unmasculine</i>
    generosity, and Queen Victoria does not sit upon a mat after the
    fashion of Queen Pomare, nor should.
</p>
<p>
    But ... but ... you know very fully that you are breaking faith in the
    matter of the 'Tragedy' and 'Luria'&mdash;you promised to rest&mdash;and <i>you
    rest for three days</i>. Is it <i>so</i> that people get well? or keep well?
    Indeed I do not think I shall let you have 'Luria.' Ah&mdash;be careful, I
    do beseech you&mdash;be careful. There is time for a pause, and the works
    will profit by it themselves. And <i>you</i>! And I ... if you are ill!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    For the rest I will let you walk in my field, and see my elms as much
    as you please ... though I hear about the shower bath with a little
    suspicion. Why, if it did you harm before, should it not again? and
    why should you use it, if it threatens harm? Now tell me if it hasn't
    made you rather unwell since the new trial!&mdash;tell me, dear, dearest.
</p>
<p>
    As for myself, I believe that you set about exhorting me to be busy,
    just that I might not reproach <i>you</i> for the over-business. Confess
    that <i>that</i> was the only meaning of the exhortation. But no, you are
    quite serious, you say. You even threaten me in a sort of underground
    murmur, which sounds like a nascent earthquake; and if I do not write
    so much a day directly, your stipendiary magistrateship will take away
    my license to be loved ... I am not to be Ba to you any longer ... you
    say! And is <i>this</i> right? now I ask you. Ever so many chrystals fell
    off by that stroke of the baton, I do assure you. Only you did not
    mean quite what you said so too articulately, and you will unsay it,
    if you please, and unthink it near the elms.
</p>
<p>
    As for the writing, I will write ... I have written ... I am writing.
    You do not fancy that I have given up writing?&mdash;No. Only I have
    certainly been more loitering and distracted than usual in what I have
    done, which is not my fault&mdash;nor yours directly&mdash;and I feel an
    indisposition to setting about the romance, the hand of the soul
    shakes. I am too happy and not calm enough, I suppose, to have the
    right inclination. Well&mdash;it will come. But all in blots and fragments
    there are verses enough, to fill a volume done in the last year.
</p>
<p>
    And if there were not ... if there were none ... I hold that I should
    be Ba, and also <i>your</i> Ba ... which is 'insolence' ... will you say?

    As for the 'third person,' my sweet Ba, he was a wise speaker from the
    beginning; and in our case he will say, turning to me&mdash;'the late
    Robert Hall&mdash;when a friend admired that one with so high an estimate
    of the value of intellectuality in woman should yet marry some kind of
    cook-maid animal, as did the said Robert; wisely answered, "you can't
    kiss Mind"! May <i>you</i> not discover eventually,' (this is to me) 'that
    mere intellectual endowments&mdash;though incontestably of the loftiest
    character&mdash;mere Mind, though that Mind be Miss B's&mdash;cannot be
    <i>kissed</i>&mdash;nor, repent too late the absence of those humbler qualities,
    those softer affections which, like flowerets at the mountain's foot,
    if not so proudly soaring as, as, as!...' and so on, till one of us
    died, with laughing or being laughed at! So judges the third person!
    and if, to help him, we let him into your room at Wimpole Street,
    suffered him to see with Flush's eyes, he would say with just as wise
    an air 'True, mere personal affections may be warm enough, but does it
    augur well for the durability of an attachment that it should be
    <i>wholly, exclusively</i> based on such perishable attractions as the
    sweetness of a mouth, the beauty of an eye? I could wish, rather, to
    know that there was something of less transitory nature co-existent
    with this&mdash;some congeniality of Mental pursuit, some&mdash;' Would he not
    say that? But I can't do his platitudes justice because here is our
    post going out and I have been all the morning walking in the perfect
    joy of my heart, with your letter, and under its blessing&mdash;dearest,
    dearest Ba&mdash;let me say more to-morrow&mdash;only this now, that you&mdash;ah,

[Post-mark, February 27, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    If all third persons were as foolish as this third person of yours,
    ever dearest, first and second persons might follow their own devices
    without losing much in the way of good counsel. But you are unlucky in
    your third person as far as the wits go, he talks a great deal of
    nonsense, and Flush, who is sensible, will have nothing to do with
    him, he says, any more than you will with Sir Moses:&mdash;he is quite a
    third person <i>singular</i> for the nonsense he talks!
</p>
<p>
    So, instead of him, you shall hear what I have been doing to-day. The
    sun, which drew out you and the hawthorns, persuaded me that it was
    warm enough to go down-stairs&mdash;and I put on my cloak as if I were
    going into the snow, and went into the drawing-room and took
    Henrietta by surprise as she sate at the piano singing. Well, I meant
    to stay half an hour and come back again, for I am upon 'Tinkler's
    ground' in the drawing-room and liable to whole droves of morning
    visitors&mdash;and Henrietta kept me, kept me, because she wanted me,
    besought me, to stay and see the great sight of Capt. Surtees
    Cook&mdash;<i>plus</i> his regimentals&mdash;fresh from the royal presence at St.
    James's, and I never saw him in my life, though he is a sort of
    cousin. So, though I hated it as you may think, ... not liking to be
    unkind to my sister, I stayed and stayed one ten minutes after
    another, till it seemed plain that he wasn't coming at all (as I told
    her) and that Victoria had kept him to dinner, enchanted with the
    regimentals. And half laughing and half quarrelling, still she kept me
    by force, until a knock came most significantly ... and '<i>There</i> is
    Surtees' said she ... 'now you must and shall stay! So foolish,' (I
    had my hand on the door-handle to go out) 'he, your own cousin too!
    who always calls you Ba, except before Papa.' Which might have
    encouraged me perhaps, but I can't be sure of it, as the very next
    moment apprized us both that no less a person than Mrs. Jameson was
    standing out in the passage. The whole 36th. regiment could scarcely
    have been more astounding to me. As to staying to see her in that
    room, with the prospect of the military descent in combination, I
    couldn't have done it for the world! so I made Henrietta, who had
    drawn me into the scrape, take her up-stairs, and followed myself in a
    minute or two&mdash;and the corollary of this interesting history is, that
    being able to talk at all after all that 'fuss,' and after walking
    'up-stairs and down-stairs' like the ancestor of your spider, proves
    my gigantic strength&mdash;now doesn't it?
</p>
<p>
    For the rest, 'here be proofs' that the first person can be as foolish
    as any third person in the world. What do you think?
</p>
<p>
    And Mrs. Jameson was kind beyond speaking of, and talked of taking me
    to Italy. What do you say? It is somewhere about the fifth or sixth
    proposition of the sort which has come to me. I shall be embarrassed,
    it seems to me, by the multitude of escorts to Italy. But the
    kindness, one cannot laugh at so much kindness.
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to hear her speak of you, and was afraid. I <i>could not</i> name
    you. Yet I <i>did</i> want to hear the last 'Bell' praised.
</p>
<p>
    She goes to Ireland for two months soon, but prints a book first, a
    collection of essays. I have not seen Mr. Kenyon, with whom she dined
    yesterday. The Macreadys were to be there, and he told me a week ago
    that he very nearly committed himself in a 'social mistake' by
    inviting you to meet them.
</p>
<p>
    Ah my hawthorn spray! Do you know, I caught myself pitying it for
    being gathered, with that green promise of leaves on it! There is room
    too on it for the feet of a bird! Still I shall keep it longer than it
    would have stayed in the hedge, <i>that</i> is certain!
</p>
<p>
    The first you ever gave me was a yellow rose sent in a letter, and
    shall I tell you what <i>that</i> means&mdash;the yellow rose? '<i>Infidelity</i>,'
    says the dictionary of flowers. You see what an omen, ... to begin
    with!
</p>
<p>
    Also you see that I am not tired with the great avatar to-day&mdash;the
    'fell swoop' rather&mdash;mine, into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Jameson's
    on <i>me</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And I shall hear to-morrow again, really? I '<i>let</i>' you. And you are
    best, kindest, dearest, every day. Did I ever tell you that you made
    me do what you choose? I fancied that I only <i>thought</i> so. May God
    bless you. I am your own.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I have the 'Soul's Tragedy' on Saturday?&mdash;any of it? But <i>do not
    work</i>&mdash;I beseech you to take care.

    To be sure my 'first person' was nonsensical, and, in that respect
    made speak properly, I hope, only he was cut short in the middle of
    his performance by the exigencies of the post. So, never mind what
    such persons say, my sweetest, because they know nothing at all&mdash;<i>quod
    erat demonstrandum</i>. But you, love, you speak roses, and
    hawthorn-blossoms when you tell me of the cloak put on, and the
    descent, and the entry, and staying and delaying. I will have had a
    hand in all that; I know what I wished all the morning, and now this
    much came true! But you should have seen the regimentals, if I could
    have so contrived it, for I confess to a Chinese love for bright
    red&mdash;the very names 'vermilion' 'scarlet' warm me, yet in this cold
    climate nobody wears red to comfort one's eye save soldiers and fox
    hunters, and old women fresh from a Parish Christmas Distribution of
    cloaks. To dress in floating loose crimson silk, I almost understand
    being a Cardinal! Do you know anything of Nat Lee's Tragedies? In one
    of them a man angry with a Cardinal cries&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Stand back, and let me mow this poppy down,<br>
This rank red weed that spoils the Churches' corn.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0em">Is not that good? and presently, when the same worthy is poisoned
    (that is the Cardinal)&mdash;they bid him&mdash;'now, Cardinal, lie down and
    roar!'
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Think of thy scarlet sins!
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em">Of the justice of all which, you will judge with no Mrs. Jameson for
    guide when we see the Sistina together, I trust! By the way, yesterday
    I went to Dulwich to see some pictures, by old Teniers, Murillo,
    Gainsborough, Raphael!&mdash;then twenty names about, and last but one, as
    if just thought of, 'Correggio.' The whole collection, including 'a
    <i>divine</i> picture by Murillo,' and Titian's Daughter (hitherto supposed
    to be in the Louvre)&mdash;the whole I would, I think, have cheerfully
    given a pound or two for the privilege of not possessing&mdash;so execrable
    as sign-paintings even! 'Are there worse poets in their way than
    painters?' Yet the melancholy business is here&mdash;that the bad poet goes
    out of his way, writes his verses in the language he learned in order
    to do a hundred other things with it, all of which he can go on and do
    afterwards&mdash;but the painter has spent the best of his life in learning
    even how to produce such monstrosities as these, and to what other
    good do his acquisitions go? This short minute of life our one chance,
    an eternity on either side! and a man does not walk whistling and
    ruddy by the side of hawthorn hedges in spring, but shuts himself up
    and conies out after a dozen years with 'Titian's Daughter' and,
    there, gone is his life, let somebody else try!
</p>
<p>
    I have tried&mdash;my trial is made too!
</p>
<p>
    To-morrow you shall tell me, dearest, that Mrs. Jameson wondered to
    see you so well&mdash;did she not wonder? Ah, to-morrow! There is a lesson
    from all this writing and mistaking and correcting and being
    corrected; and what, but that a word goes safely only from lip to lip,
    dearest? See how the cup slipped from the lip and snapped the
    chrystals, you say! But the writing is but for a time&mdash;'a time and
    times and half a time!'&mdash;would I knew when the prophetic weeks end!
    Still, one day, as I say, no more writing, (and great scandalization
    of the third person, peeping through the fringes of Flush's ears!)
    meanwhile, I wonder whether if I meet Mrs. Jameson I may practise
    diplomacy and say carelessly 'I should be glad to know what Miss B. is
    like&mdash;' No, that I must not do, something tells me, 'for reasons, for
    reasons'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    I do not know&mdash;you may perhaps have to wait a little longer for my
    'divine Murillo' of a Tragedy. My sister is copying it as I give the
    pages, but&mdash;in fact my wise head does ache a little&mdash;it is
    inconceivable! As if it took a great storm to topple over some stone,
    and once the stone pushed from its right place, any bird's foot, which
    would hardly bend the hawthorn spray, may set it trembling! The aching
    begins with reading the presentation-list at the Drawing-room quite
    naturally, and with no shame at all! But it is gentle, well-behaved
    aching now, so I <i>do</i> care, as you bid me, Ba, my Ba, whom I call Ba
    to my heart but could not, I really believe, call so before another,
    even your sister, if&mdash;if&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    But Ba, I call you boldly here, and I dare kiss your dear, dear eyes,
    till to-morrow&mdash;Bless you, my own.

<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, March 2, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You never could think that I meant any insinuation against you by a
    word of what was said yesterday, or that I sought or am likely to seek
    a 'security'! do you know it was not right of you to use such an
    expression&mdash;indeed no. You were angry with me for just one minute, or
    you would not have used it&mdash;and why? Now what did I say that was wrong
    or unkind even by construction? If I did say anything, it was three
    times wrong, and unjust as well as unkind, and wronged my own heart
    and consciousness of all that you are to me, more than it could <i>you</i>.
    But you began speaking of yourself just as a woman might speak under
    the same circumstances (you remember what you said), and then <i>I</i>,
    remembering that all the men in the world would laugh such an idea to
    scorn, said something to that effect, you <i>know</i>. I once was in
    company with a man, however, who valued himself very much on his
    constancy to a woman who was so deeply affected by it that she became
    his wife at last ... and the whole neighbourhood came out to stare at
    him on that ground as a sort of monster. And can you guess what the
    constancy meant? Seven years before, he loved that woman, he said, and
    she repulsed him. 'And in the meantime, <i>how many</i>?' I had the
    impertinence to ask a female friend who told me the tale. 'Why,' she
    answered with the utmost simplicity, 'I understand that Miss A. and
    Miss B. and Mrs. C. would not listen to him, but he took Miss D.'s
    rejection most to heart.' That was the head and front of his
    'constancy' to Miss E., who had been loved, she boasted, for seven
    years ... that is, once at the beginning and once at the end. It was
    just a coincidence of the 'premier pas' and the 'pis aller.'
</p>
<p>
    Beloved, I could not mean this for you; you are not made of such
    stuff, as we both know.
</p>
<p>
    And for myself, it was my compromise with my own scruples, that you
    should not be 'chained' to me, not in the merest metaphor, that you
    should not seem to be bound, in honour or otherwise, so that if you
    stayed with me it should be your free choice to stay, not the
    <i>consequence</i> of a choice so many months before. That was my
    compromise with my scruples, and not my doubt of your affection&mdash;and
    least of all, was it an intention of trifling with you sooner or later
    that made me wish to suspend all <i>decisions</i> as long as possible. I
    have decided (for me) to let it be as you shall please&mdash;now I told you
    that before. Either we will live on as we are, until an obstacle
    arises,&mdash;for indeed I do not look for a 'security' where you suppose,
    and the very appearance of it <i>there</i>, is what most rebuts me&mdash;or I
    will be yours in the obvious way, to go out of England the next
    half-hour if possible. As to the steps to be taken (or not taken)
    before the last step, we must think of those. The worst is that the
    only question is about a <i>form</i>. Virtually the evil is the same all
    round, whatever we do. Dearest, it was plain to see yesterday evening
    when he came into this room for a moment at seven o'clock, before
    going to his own to dress for dinner ... plain to see, that he was not
    altogether pleased at finding you here in the morning. There was no
    pretext for objecting gravely&mdash;but it was plain that he was not
    pleased. Do not let this make you uncomfortable, he will forget all
    about it, and I was not <i>scolded</i>, do you understand. It was more
    manner, but my sisters thought as I did of the significance:&mdash;and it
    was enough to prove to me (if I had not known) what a desperate game
    we should be playing if we depended on a yielding nerve <i>there</i>.
</p>
<p>
    And to-day I went down-stairs (to prove how my promises stand) though
    I could find at least ten good excuses for remaining in my own room,
    for our cousin, Sam Barrett, who brought the interruption yesterday
    and put me out of humour (it wasn't the fault of the dear little
    cousin, Lizzie ... my 'portrait' ... who was '<i>so</i> sorry,' she said,
    dear child, to have missed Papa somewhere on the stairs!) the cousin
    who should have been in Brittany yesterday instead of here, sate in
    the drawing-room all this morning, and had visitors there, and so I
    had excellent excuses for never moving from my chair. Yet, the field
    being clear at <i>half-past two</i>! I went for half an hour, just&mdash;just
    for <i>you</i>. Did you think of me, I wonder? It was to meet your thoughts
    that I went, dear dearest.
</p>
<p>
    How clever these sketches are. The expression produced by such
    apparently inadequate means is quite striking; and I have been making
    my brothers admire them, and they 'wonder you don't think of employing
    them in an illustrated edition of your works.' Which might be, really!
    Ah, you did not ask for 'Luria'! Not that I should have let you have
    it!&mdash;I think I should not indeed. Dearest, you take care of the head
    ... and don't make that tragedy of the soul one for mine, by letting
    it make you ill. Beware too of the shower-bath&mdash;it plainly does not
    answer for you at this season. And walk, and think of me for <i>your</i>
    good, if such a combination should be possible.

<p>
    And <i>I</i> think of <i>you</i> ... if I do not of Italy. Yet I forget to speak
    to you of the Dulwich Gallery. I never saw those pictures, but am
    astonished that the whole world should be wrong in praising them.
    'Divine' is a bad word for Murillo in any case&mdash;because he is
    intensely human in his most supernatural subjects. His beautiful
    Trinity in the National Gallery, which I saw the last time I went out
    to look at pictures, has no deity in it&mdash;and I seem to see it now. And
    do you remember the visitation of the angels to Abraham (the Duke of
    Sutherland's picture&mdash;is it not?) where the mystic visitors look like
    shepherds who had not even dreamt of God? But I always understood that
    that Dulwich Gallery was famous for great works&mdash;you surprise me! And
    for painters ... their badness is more ostentatious than that of
    poets&mdash;they stare idiocy out of the walls, and set the eyes of
    sensitive men on edge. For the rest, however, I very much doubt
    whether they wear their lives more to rags, than writers who mistake
    their vocation in poetry do. There is a mechanism in poetry as in the
    other art&mdash;and, to men not native to the way of it, it runs hard and
    heavily. The 'cudgelling of the brain' is as good labour as the
    grinding of the colours, ... do you not think?
</p>
<p>
    If ever I am in the Sistine Chapel, it will not be with Mrs.
    Jameson&mdash;no. If ever I should be there, what teaching I shall want,
    <i>I</i> who have seen so few pictures, and love them only as children do,
    with an unlearned love, just for the sake of the thoughts they bring.
    Wonderfully ignorant I am, to have had eyes and ears so long! There is
    music, now, which lifts the hair on my head, I feel it so much, ...
    yet all I know of it as art, all I have heard of the works of the
    masters in it, has been the mere sign and suggestion, such as the
    private piano may give. I never heard an oratorio, for instance, in my
    life&mdash;judge by <i>that</i>! It is a guess, I make, at all the greatness and
    divinity ... feeling in it, though, distinctly and certainly, that a
    composer like Beethoven <i>must</i> stand above the divinest painter in
    soul-godhead, and nearest to the true poet, of all artists. And this
    I felt in my guess, long before I knew you. But observe how, if I had
    died in this illness, I should have left a sealed world behind me!
    <i>you</i>, unknown too&mdash;unguessed at, <i>you</i>, ... in many respects,
    wonderfully unguessed at! Lately I have learnt to despise my own
    instincts. And apart from those&mdash;and <i>you</i>, ... it was right for me to
    be melancholy, in the consciousness of passing blindfolded under all
    the world-stars, and of going out into another side of the creation,
    with a blank for the experience of this ... the last revelation,
    unread! How the thought of it used to depress me sometimes!
</p>
<p>
    Talking of music, I had a proposition the other day from certain of
    Mr. Russell's (the singer's) friends, about his setting to music my
    'Cry of the Children.' His programme exhibits all the horrors of the
    world, I see! Lifeboats ... madhouses ... gamblers' wives ... all done
    to the right sort of moaning. His audiences must go home delightfully
    miserable, I should fancy. He has set the 'Song of the Shirt' ... and
    my 'Cry of the Children' will be acceptable, it is supposed, as a
    climax of agony. Do you know this Mr. Russell, and what sort of music
    he suits to his melancholy? But to turn my 'Cry' to a 'Song,' a
    burden, it is said, is required&mdash;he can't sing it without a burden!
    and behold what has been sent 'for my approval'.... I shall copy it
    <i>verbatim</i> for you....

</p>
<p>
    One or two words, if no more, I must write to dearest Ba, the night
    would go down in double blackness if I had neither written nor been
    written to! So here is another piece of 'kindness' on my part, such as
    I have received praise for of late! My own sweetest, there is just
    this good in such praise, that by it one comes to something pleasantly
    definite amid the hazy uncertainties of mere wishes and
    possibilities&mdash;while my whole heart does, <i>does</i> so yearn, love, to do
    something to prove its devotion for you; and, now and then, amuses
    itself with foolish imaginings of real substantial services to which
    it should be found equal if fortune so granted; suddenly you interpose
    with thanks, in such terms as would all too much reward the highest of
    even those services which are never to be; and for what?&mdash;for a note,
    a going to Town, a &mdash;&mdash;! Well, there are definite beginnings
    certainly, if you will recognise them&mdash;I mean, that since you <i>do</i>
    accept, far from 'despising this day of small things,' then I may
    take heart, and be sure that even though none of the great
    achievements should fall to my happy chance, still the barrenest,
    flattest life will&mdash;<i>must</i> of needs produce in its season better
    fruits than these poor ones&mdash;I keep it, value it, now, that it may
    produce such.
</p>
<p>
    Also I determine never again to 'analyse,' nor let you analyse if the
    sweet mouth can be anyway stopped: the love shall be one and
    indivisible&mdash;and the Loves we used to know from

</p>
<p>
    Upon the whole, I think, I am glad when you are kept in town and
    prevented from writing what you call 'much' to me. Because in the
    first place, the little from <i>you</i>, is always much to <i>me</i>&mdash;and then,
    besides, <i>the letter comes</i>, and with it the promise of another! Two
    letters have I had from you to-day, ever dearest! How I thank
    you!&mdash;yes, <i>indeed</i>! It was like yourself to write yesterday ... to
    remember what a great gap there would have been otherwise, as it
    looked on this side&mdash;here. The worst of Saturday is (when you come on
    it) that Sunday follows&mdash;Saturday night bringing no letter. Well, it
    was very good of you, best of you!
</p>
<p>
    For the 'analyzing' I give it up willingly, only that I must say what
    altogether I forgot to say in my last letter, that it was not <i>I</i>, if
    you please, who spoke of the chrystals breaking away! And you, to
    quote me with that certainty! "The chrystals are broken off," <i>you
    say</i>.' <i>I</i> say!! When it was in your letter, and not at all in mine!!
</p>
<p>
    The truth is that I was stupid, rather, about the Dulwich
    collection&mdash;it was my fault. I caught up the idea of the gallery out
    of a heap of other thoughts, and really might have known better if I
    had given myself a chance, by considering.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon came to-day, and has taken out a licence, it seems to me,
    for praising you, for he praised and praised. Somebody has told him
    (who had spent several days with you in a house with a large library)
    that he came away 'quite astounded by the versatility of your
    learning'&mdash;and that, to complete the circle, you discoursed as
    scientifically on the training of greyhounds and breeding of ducks as
    if you had never done anything else all your life. Then dear Mr.
    Kenyon talked of the poems; and hoped, very earnestly I am sure, that
    you would finish 'Saul'&mdash;which you ought to do, must do&mdash;<i>only not
    now</i>. By the way Mrs. Coleridge had written to him to enquire whether
    you had authority for the 'blue lilies,' rather than white. Then he
    asked about 'Luria' and 'whether it was obscure'; and I said, not
    unless the people, who considered it, began by blindfolding
    themselves.
</p>
<p>
    And where do you think Mr. Kenyon talks of going next February&mdash;a long
    while off to be sure? To Italy of course. Everybody I ever heard of
    seems to be going to Italy next winter. He visits his brother at
    Vienna, and 'may cross the Alps and get to Pisa'&mdash;it is the shadow of
    a scheme&mdash;nothing certain, so far.
</p>
<p>
    I did not go down-stairs to-day because the wind blew and the
    thermometer fell. To-morrow, perhaps I may. And <i>you</i>, dearest
    dearest, might have put into the letters how you were when you wrote
    them. You might&mdash;but you did not feel well and would not say so.
    Confess that that was the reason. Reason or no reason, mention
    yourself to-morrow, and for the rest, do not write a long letter so as
    to increase the evil. There was nothing which I can remember as
    requiring an answer in what I wrote to you, and though I <i>will</i> have
    my letter of course, it shall be as brief as possible, if briefness is
    good for you&mdash;<i>now always remember that</i>. Why if I, who talk against
    'Luria,' should work the mischief myself, what should I deserve? I
    should be my own jury directly and not recommend to mercy ... not to
    mine. Do take care&mdash;care for <i>me</i> just so much.
</p>
<p>
    And, except that taking care of your health, what would you do for me
    that you have not done? You have given me the best of the possible
    gifts of one human soul to another, you have made my life new, and am
    I to count these things as small and insufficient? Ah, you <i>know</i>, you
    <i>know</i> that I cannot, ought not, will not.
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. He blesses me in letting me be grateful to you as
    your Ba.

<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.<br>
[Post-mark, March 3, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    First and most important of all,&mdash;dearest, 'angry'&mdash;with you, and for
    <i>that</i>! It is just as if I had spoken contemptuously of that Gallery I
    so love and so am grateful to&mdash;having been used to go there when a
    child, far under the age allowed by the regulations&mdash;those two Guidos,
    the wonderful Rembrandt of Jacob's vision, such a Watteau, the
    triumphant three Murillo pictures, a Giorgione music-lesson group,
    all the Poussins with the 'Armida' and 'Jupiter's nursing'&mdash;and&mdash;no
    end to 'ands'&mdash;I have sate before one, some <i>one</i> of those pictures I
    had predetermined to see, a good hour and then gone away ... it used
    to be a green half-hour's walk over the fields. So much for one error,
    now for the second like unto it; what I meant by charging you with
    <i>seeing</i>, (not, <i>not</i> '<i>looking</i> for')&mdash;<i>seeing</i> undue 'security' in
    <i>that</i>, in the form,&mdash;I meant to say 'you talk about me being 'free'
    now, free till <i>then</i>, and I am rather jealous of the potency
    attributed to the <i>form</i>, with all its solemnity, because it <i>is</i> a
    form, and no more&mdash;yet you frankly agree with me that <i>that</i> form
    complied with, there is no redemption; yours I am <i>then</i> sure enough,
    to repent at leisure &amp;c. &amp;c.' So I meant to ask, 'then, all <i>now</i>
    said, all short of that particular form of saying it, all goes for
    comparatively nothing'? Here it is written down&mdash;you 'wish to
    <i>suspend</i> all decisions as long as possible'&mdash;<i>that</i> form effects the
    decision, then,&mdash;till then, 'where am I'? Which is just what Lord
    Chesterfield cautions people against asking when they tell stories.
    Love, Ba, my own heart's dearest, if all is <i>not</i> decided
    <i>now</i>&mdash;why&mdash;hear a story, à propos of storytelling, and deduce what is
    deducible. A very old Unitarian minister met a still older evangelical
    brother&mdash;John Clayton (from whose son's mouth I heard what you shall
    hear)&mdash;the two fell to argument about the true faith to be held&mdash;after
    words enough, 'Well,' said the Unitarian, as winding up the
    controversy with an amicable smile&mdash;'at least let us hope we are both
    engaged in the <i>pursuit</i> of Truth!'&mdash;'<i>Pursuit</i> do you say?' cried the
    other, 'here am I with my years eighty and odd&mdash;if I haven't <i>found</i>
    Truth by this time where is my chance, pray?' My own Ba, if I have not
    already <i>decided</i>, alas for me and the solemn words that are to help!
    Though in another point of view there would be some luxurious feeling,
    beyond the ordinary, in knowing one was kept safe to one's heart's
    good by yet another wall than the hitherto recognised ones. Is there
    any parallel in the notion I once heard a man deliver himself of in
    the street&mdash;a labourer talking with his friends about '<i>wishes</i>'&mdash;and
    this one wished, if he might get his wish, 'to have a nine gallon cask
    of strong ale set running that minute and his own mouth to be <i>tied</i>
    under it'&mdash;the exquisiteness of the delight was to be in the security
    upon security,&mdash;the being 'tied.' Now, Ba says I shall not be
    'chained' if she can help!
</p>
<p>
    But now&mdash;here all the jesting goes. You tell me what was observed in
    the 'moment's' visit; by you, and (after, I suppose) by your sisters.
    First, I <i>will</i> always see with your eyes <i>there</i>&mdash;next, what I see I
    will <i>never</i> speak, if it pain you; but just this much truth I ought
    to say, I think. I always give myself to you for the worst I am,&mdash;full
    of faults as you will find, if you have not found them. But I <i>will</i>
    not affect to be so bad, so wicked, as I count wickedness, as to call
    that conduct other than intolerable&mdash;<i>there</i>, in my conviction of
    <i>that</i>, is your real 'security' and mine for the future as the
    present. That a father choosing to give out of his whole day some five
    minutes to a daughter, supposed to be prevented from participating in
    what he, probably, in common with the whole world of sensible men, as
    distinguished from poets and dreamers, consider <i>every</i> pleasure of
    life, by a complete foregoing of society&mdash;that he, after the Pisa
    business and the enforced continuance, and as he must believe,
    permanence of this state in which any other human being would go
    mad&mdash;I do dare say, for the justification of God, who gave the mind to
    be <i>used</i> in this world,&mdash;where it saves us, we are taught, or
    destroys us,&mdash;and not to be sunk quietly, overlooked, and forgotten;
    that, under these circumstances, finding ... what, you say, unless he
    thinks he <i>does</i> find, he would close the door of his house instantly;
    a mere sympathizing man, of the same literary tastes, who comes
    good-naturedly, on a proper and unexceptionable introduction, to chat
    with and amuse a little that invalid daughter, once a month, so far as
    is known, for an hour perhaps,&mdash;that such a father should show
    himself '<i>not pleased</i> plainly,' at such a circumstance ... my Ba, it
    is <SPAN class="sc-ex">shocking</span>! See, I go <i>wholly</i> on the supposition that the real
    relation is not imagined to exist between us. I so completely could
    understand a repugnance to trust you to me were the truth known, that,
    I will confess, I have several times been afraid the very reverse of
    this occurrence would befall; that your father would have at some time
    or other thought himself obliged, by the usual feeling of people in
    such cases, to see me for a few minutes and express some commonplace
    thanks after the customary mode (just as Capt. Domett sent a heap of
    unnecessary thanks to me not long ago for sending now a letter now a
    book to his son in New Zealand&mdash;keeping up the spirits of poor dear
    Alfred now he is cut off from the world at large)&mdash;and if <i>this</i> had
    been done, I shall not deny that my heart would have accused
    me&mdash;unreasonably I <i>know</i> but still, suppression, and reserve, and
    apprehension&mdash;the whole of <i>that is</i> horrible always! But this way of
    looking on the endeavour of anybody, however humble, to just preserve
    your life, remedy in some degree the first, if it <i>was</i> the first,
    unjustifiable measure,&mdash;this being 'displeased'&mdash;is exactly what I did
    <i>not</i> calculate upon. Observe, that in this <i>only</i> instance I am able
    to do as I shall be done by; to take up the arms furnished by the
    world, the usages of society&mdash;this is monstrous on the <i>world's</i>
    showing! I say this now that I may never need recur to it&mdash;that you
    may understand why I keep <i>such</i> entire silence henceforth.
</p>
<p>
    Get but well, keep but <i>as</i> well, and all is easy now. This wonderful
    winter&mdash;the spring&mdash;the summer&mdash;you will take exercise, go up and down
    stairs, get strong. <i>I pray you, at your feet, to do this, dearest!</i>
    Then comes Autumn, with the natural expectations, as after <i>rouge</i> one
    expects <i>noir</i>: the <i>likelihood</i> of a <i>severe</i> winter after this mild
    one, which to prevent, you reiterate your demand to go and save your
    life in Italy, ought you not to do that? And the matters brought to
    issue, (with even, if possible, less shadow of ground for a refusal
    than before, if you are <i>well</i>, plainly well enough to bear the
    voyage) <i>there</i> I <i>will</i> bid you 'be mine in the obvious way'&mdash;if you
    shall preserve your belief in me&mdash;and you <i>may</i> in much, in all
    important to you. Mr. Kenyon's praise is undeserved enough, but
    yesterday Milnes said I was the only literary man he ever knew, <i>tenax
    propositi</i>, able to make out a life for himself and abide in
    it&mdash;'for,' he went on, 'you really do live without any of this
    <i>titillation</i> and fussy dependence upon adventitious excitement of all
    kinds, they all say they can do without.' That is <i>more</i> true&mdash;and I
    <i>intend</i> by God's help to live wholly for you; to spend my whole
    energies in reducing to practice the feeling which occupies me, and in
    the practical operation of which, the other work I had proposed to do
    will be found included, facilitated&mdash;I shall be able&mdash;but of this
    there is plenty time to speak hereafter&mdash;I shall, I believe, be able
    to do this without even allowing the world to <i>very much</i>
    misinterpret&mdash;against pure lying there is no defence, but all up to
    that I hope to hinder or render unimportant&mdash;as you shall know in time
    and place.
</p>
<p>
    I have written myself grave, but write to <i>me</i>, dear, dearest, and I
    will answer in a lighter mood&mdash;even now I can say how it was
    yesterday's hurry happened. I called on Milnes&mdash;who told me Hanmer had
    broken a bone in his leg and was laid up, so I called on him too&mdash;on
    Moxon, by the way, (his brother telling me strangely cheering news,
    from the grimmest of faces, about my books selling and likely to sell
    ... your wishes, Ba!)&mdash;then in Bond Street about some business with
    somebody, then on Mrs. Montagu who was out walking all the time, and
    home too. I found a letter from Mr. Kenyon, perfectly kind, asking me
    to go on Monday to meet friends, and with yours to-day comes another
    confirming the choice of the day. How entirely kind he is!
</p>
<p>
    I am very well, much better, indeed&mdash;taking that bath with sensibly
    good effect, to-night I go to Montagu's again; for shame, having kept
    away too long.
</p>
<p>
    And the rest shall answer <i>yours</i>&mdash;dear! Not 'much to answer?' And
    Beethoven, and Painting and&mdash;what <i>is</i> the rest and shall be answered!
    Bless you, now, my darling&mdash;I love you, ever shall love you, ever be
    your own.

<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, March 4, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Yes, but, dearest, you mistake me, or you mistake yourself. I am sure
    I do not over-care for forms&mdash;it is not my way to do it&mdash;and in this
    case ... no. Still you must see that here is a fact as well as a form,
    and involving a frightful quantity of social inconvenience (to use the
    mildest word) if too hastily entered on. I deny altogether looking
    for, or 'seeing' any 'security' in it for myself&mdash;it is a mere form
    for the heart and the happiness: illusions may pass after as before.
    Still the truth is that if they were to pass with you now, you stand
    free to act according to the wide-awakeness of your eyes, and to
    reform your choice ... see! whereas afterward you could not carry out
    such a reformation while I was alive, even if I helped you. All I
    could do for you would be to walk away. And you pretend not to see
    this broad distinction?&mdash;ah. For me I have seen just this and no more,
    and have felt averse to forestall, to seem to forestall even by an
    hour, or a word, that stringency of the legal obligation from which
    there <i>is</i> in a certain sense no redemption. Tie up your drinker under
    the pour of his nine gallons, and in two minutes he will moan and
    writhe (as you perfectly know) like a Brinvilliers under the
    water-torture. That he <i>asked</i> to be tied up, was unwise on his own
    principle of loving ale. And <i>you</i> sha'n't be 'chained' up, if you
    were to ask twenty times: if you have found truth or not in the
    water-well.
</p>
<p>
    You do not see aright what I meant to tell you on another subject. If
    he was displeased, (and it was expressed by a shadow a mere negation
    of pleasure) it was not with you as a visitor and my friend. You must
    not fancy such a thing. It was a sort of instinctive indisposition
    towards seeing you here&mdash;unexplained to himself, I have no doubt&mdash;of
    course unexplained, or he would have desired me to receive you never
    again, <i>that</i> would have been done at once and unscrupulously. But
    without defining his own feeling, he rather disliked seeing you
    here&mdash;it just touched one of his vibratory wires, brushed by and
    touched it&mdash;oh, we understand in this house. He is not a nice
    observer, but, at intervals very wide, he is subject to
    lightnings&mdash;call them fancies, sometimes right, sometimes wrong.
    Certainly it was not in the character of a 'sympathising friend' that
    you made him a very little cross on Monday. And yet you never were nor
    will be in danger of being <i>thanked</i>, he would not think of it. For
    the reserve, the apprehension&mdash;dreadful those things are, and
    desecrating to one's own nature&mdash;but we did not make this position, we
    only endure it. The root of the evil is the miserable misconception of
    the limits and character of parental rights&mdash;it is a mistake of the
    intellect rather than of the heart. Then, after using one's children
    as one's chattels for a time, the children drop lower and lower toward
    the level of the chattels, and the duties of human sympathy to them
    become difficult in proportion. And (it seems strange to say it, yet
    it is true) <i>love</i>, he does not conceive of at all. He has feeling, he
    can be moved deeply, he is capable of affection in a peculiar way, but
    <i>that</i>, he does not understand, any more than he understands Chaldee,
    respecting it less of course.
</p>
<p>
    And you fancy that I could propose Italy again? after saying too that
    I never would? Oh no, no&mdash;yet there is time to think of this, a
    superfluity of time, ... 'time, times and half a time' and to make
    one's head swim with leaning over a precipice is not wise. The roar
    of the world comes up too, as you hear and as I heard from the
    beginning. There will be no lack of 'lying,' be sure&mdash;'pure lying'
    too&mdash;and nothing you can do, dearest dearest, shall hinder my being
    torn to pieces by most of the particularly affectionate friends I have
    in the world. Which I do not think of much, any more than of Italy.
    You will be mad, and I shall be bad ... and <i>that</i> will be the effect
    of being poets! 'Till when, where are you?'&mdash;why in the very deepest
    of my soul&mdash;wherever in it is the fountain head of loving! beloved,
    <i>there</i> you are!
</p>
<p>
    Some day I shall ask you 'in form,'&mdash;as I care so much for forms, it
    seems,&mdash;what your 'faults' are, these immense multitudinous faults of
    yours, which I hear such talk of, and never, never, can get to see.
    Will you give me a catalogue raisonnée of your faults? I should like
    it, I think. In the meantime they seem to be faults of obscurity, that
    is, invisible faults, like those in the poetry which do not keep it
    from selling as I am <i>so, so</i> glad to understand. I am glad too that
    Mr. Milnes knows you a little.
</p>
<p>
    Now I must end, there is no more time to-night. God bless you, very
    dearest! Keep better ... try to be well&mdash;as <i>I</i> do for you since you
    ask me. Did I ever think that <i>you</i> would think it worth while to ask
    me <i>that</i>? What a dream! reaching out into the morning! To-day however
    I did not go down-stairs, because it was colder and the wind blew its
    way into the passages:&mdash;if I can to-morrow without risk, I will, ...
    be sure ... be sure. Till Thursday then!&mdash;till eternity!

    Ah, sweetest, don't mind people and their lies any more than I shall;
    if the toad <i>does</i> 'take it into his toad's head to spit at you'&mdash;you
    will not 'drop dead,' I warrant. All the same, if one may make a
    circuit through a flower-bed and see the less of his toad-habits and
    general ugliness, so much the better&mdash;no words can express my entire
    indifference (far below <i>contempt</i>) for what can be said or done. But
    one thing, only one, I choose to hinder being said, if I can&mdash;the
    others I would not if I could&mdash;why prevent the toad's puffing himself
    out thrice his black bigness if it amuses him among those wet stones?
    We shall be in the sun.
</p>
<p>
    I dare say I am unjust&mdash;hasty certainly, in the other matter&mdash;but all
    faults are such inasmuch as they are 'mistakes of the
    intellect'&mdash;toads may spit or leave it alone,&mdash;but if I ever see it
    right, exercising my intellect, to treat any human beings like my
    'chattels'&mdash;I shall pay for that mistake one day or another, I am

    Well, I shall see you to-morrow&mdash;had I better come a little later, I
    wonder?&mdash;half-past three, for instance, staying, as last time, till

    at the usual time to-morrow? If I do <i>not</i> hear, at the usual

[Post-mark, March 6, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ever dearest I lose no time in writing, you see, so as to be written
    to at the soonest&mdash;and there is another reason which makes me hasten
    to write ... it is not all mercantile calculation. I want you to
    understand me.
</p>
<p>
    Now listen! I seem to understand myself: it seems to me that every
    word I ever said to you on one subject, is plainly referable to a
    class of feelings of which you could not complain ... could not. But
    this is <i>my</i> impression; and yours is different:&mdash;you do not
    understand, you do not see by my light, and perhaps it is natural that
    you should not, as we stand on different steps of the argument. Still
    I, who said what I did, <i>for you</i>, and from an absorbing consideration
    of what was best <i>for you</i>, cannot consent, even out of anxiety for
    your futurity, to torment you now, to vex you by a form of speech
    which you persist in translating into a want of trust in you ... (<i>I</i>,
    want trust in you!!) into a need of more evidence about you from
    others ... (<i>could</i> you say so?) and even into an indisposition on my
    part to fulfil my engagement&mdash;no, dearest dearest, it is not right of
    you. And therefore, as you have these thoughts reasonably or
    unreasonably, I shall punish you for them at once, and 'chain' you ...
    (as you wish to be chained), chain you, rivet you&mdash;do you feel how the
    little fine chain twists round and round you? do you hear the stroke
    of the riveting? and you may <i>feel that</i> too. Now, it is done&mdash;now,
    you are chained&mdash;<i>Bia</i> has finished the work&mdash;I, <i>Ba</i>! (observe the
    anagram!) and not a word do you say, of Prometheus, though you have
    the conscience of it all, I dare say. Well! you must be pleased, ...
    as it was 'the weight of too much liberty' which offended you: and now
    you believe, perhaps, that I trust you, love you, and look to you over
    the heads of the whole living world, without any one head needing to
    stoop; you <i>must</i>, if you please, because you belong to me now and
    shall believe as I choose. There's a ukase for you! Cry out ... repent
    ... and I will loose the links, and let you go again&mdash;<i>shall</i> it be
    '<i>My dear Miss Barrett</i>?'
</p>
<p>
    Seriously, you shall not think of me such things as you half said, if
    not whole said, to-day. If all men were to speak evil of you, my heart
    would speak of you the more good&mdash;<i>that</i> would be the one result with
    <i>me</i>. Do I not know you, soul to soul? should I believe that any of
    them could know you as I know you? Then for the rest, I am not afraid
    of 'toads' now, not being a child any longer. I am not inclined to
    mind, if <i>you</i> do not mind, what may be said about us by the
    benevolent world, nor will other reasons of a graver kind affect me
    otherwise than by the necessary pain. Therefore the whole rests with
    you&mdash;unless illness should intervene&mdash;and you will be kind and good
    (will you not?) and not think hard thoughts of me ever again&mdash;no. It
    wasn't the sense of being less than you had a right to pretend to,
    which made me speak what you disliked&mdash;for it is <i>I</i> who am
    'unworthy,' and not another&mdash;not certainly that other!
</p>
<p>
    I meant to write more to-night of subjects farther off us, but my
    sisters have come up-stairs and I must close my letter quickly.
    Beloved, take care of your head! Ah, do not write poems, nor read, nor
    neglect the walking, nor take that shower-bath. <i>Will</i> you, instead,
    try the warm bathing? Surely the experiment is worth making for a

</p>
<p>
    I am altogether your own, dearest&mdash;the words were only words and the
    playful feelings were play&mdash;while the <i>fact</i> has always been so
    irresistibly obvious as to make them <i>break</i> on and off it,
    fantastically like water turning to spray and spurts of foam on a
    great solid rock. <i>Now</i> you call the rock, a rock, but you must have
    known what chance you had of pushing it down when you sent all those
    light fancies and free-leaves, and refusals-to-hold-responsible, to do
    what they could. It <i>is</i> a rock; and may be quite barren of good to
    you,&mdash;not large enough to build houses on, not small enough to make a
    mantelpiece of, much less a pedestal for a statue, but it is real
    rock, that is all.
</p>
<p>
    It is always <i>I</i> who 'torment' <i>you</i>&mdash;instead of taking the present
    and blessing you, and leaving the future to its own cares. I certainly
    am not apt to look curiously into what next week is to bring, much
    less next month or six months, but you, the having you, my own,
    dearest beloved, <i>that</i> is as different in kind as in degree from any
    other happiness or semblance of it that even seemed possible of
    realization. Then, now, the health is all to stay, or retard us&mdash;oh,
    be well, my Ba!
</p>
<p>
    Let me speak of that letter&mdash;I am ashamed at having mentioned those
    circumstances, and should not have done so, but for their
    insignificance&mdash;for I knew that if you ever <i>did</i> hear of them, all
    any body <i>would</i> say would not amount to enough to be repeated to me
    and so get explained at once. Now that the purpose is gained, it seems
    little worth gaining. You bade me not send the letter: I will not.
</p>
<p>
    As for 'what people say'&mdash;ah&mdash;Here lies a book, Bartoli's 'Simboli'
    and this morning I dipped into his Chapter XIX. His 'Symbol' is
    'Socrate fatto ritrar su' Boccali' and the theme of his dissertating,
    'L'indegnità del mettere in disprezzo i più degni filosofi
    dell'antichità.' He sets out by enlarging on the horror of it&mdash;then
    describes the character of Socrates, then tells the story of the
    representation of the 'Clouds,'and thus gets to his 'symbol'&mdash;'le
    pazzie fatte spacciare a Socrate in quella commedia ... il misero in
    tanto scherno e derisione del pubblico, che perfino i vasai
    dipingevano il suo ritratto sopra gli orci, i fiaschi, i boccali, e
    ogni vasellamento da più vile servigio. Così quel sommo filosofo ...
    fu condotto a far di se par le case d'Atene una continua commedia, con
    solamente vederlo comparir così scontraffatto e ridicolo, come i vasai
    sel formavano d'invenzione'&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    There you have what a very clever man can say in choice Tuscan on a
    passage in Ælian which he takes care not to quote nor allude to, but
    which is the sole authority for the fact. Ælian, speaking of Socrates'
    magnanimity, says that on the first representation, a good many
    foreigners being present who were at a loss to know 'who could be this
    Socrates'&mdash;the sage himself stood up that he might be pointed out to
    them by the auditory at large ... 'which' says Ælian&mdash;'was no
    difficulty for them, to whom his features were most familiar,&mdash;<i>the
    very potters being in the habit of decorating their vessels with his
    likeness</i>'&mdash;no doubt out of a pleasant and affectionate admiration.
    Yet see how 'people' can turn this out of its sense,&mdash;'say' their say
    on the simplest, plainest word or deed, and change it to its opposite!
    'God's great gift of speech abused' indeed!
</p>
<p>
    But what shall we hear of it <i>there</i>, my Siren?

    leave-taking?

</p>
<p>
    Always <i>you</i>, is it, who torments me? always <i>you</i>? Well! I agree to
    bear the torments as Socrates his persecution by the potters:&mdash;and by
    the way he liked those potters, as Plato shows, and was fain to go to
    them for his illustrations ... as I to you for all my light. Also,
    while we are on the subject, I will tell you another fault of your
    Bartoli ... his 'choice Tuscan' filled one of my pages, in the place
    of my English better than Tuscan.
</p>
<p>
    For the letter you mentioned, I meant to have said in mine yesterday,
    that I was grateful to you for telling me of it&mdash;<i>that</i> was one of the
    prodigalities of your goodness to me ... not thrown away, in one
    sense, however superfluous. Do you ever think how I must feel when you
    overcome me with all this generous tenderness, only beloved! I cannot
    say it.
</p>
<p>
    Because it is colder to-day I have not been down-stairs but let
    to-morrow be warm enough&mdash;<i>facilis descensus</i>. There's something
    infernal to me really, in the going down, and now too that our cousin
    is here! Think of his beginning to attack Henrietta the other day....
    '<i>So</i> Mr. C. has retired and left the field to Surtees Cook. Oh ...
    you needn't deny ... it's the news of all the world except your
    father. And as to <i>him</i>, I don't blame you&mdash;he never will consent to
    the marriage of son or daughter. Only you should consider, you know,
    because he won't leave you a shilling, &amp;c. &amp;c....' You hear the sort
    of man. And then in a minute after ... 'And what is this about Ba?'
    'About Ba' said my sisters, 'why who has been persuading you of such
    nonsense?' 'Oh, my authority is very good,&mdash;perfectly unnecessary for
    you to tell any stories, Arabel,&mdash;a literary friendship, is it?' ...
    and so on ... after that fashion! This comes from my brothers of
    course, but we need not be afraid of its passing <i>beyond</i>, I think,
    though I was a good deal vexed when I heard first of it last night and
    have been in cousinly anxiety ever since to get our Orestes safe away
    from those Furies his creditors, into Brittany again. He is an
    intimate friend of my brothers besides the relationship, and they talk
    to him as to each other, only they oughtn't to have talked <i>that</i>, and
    without knowledge too.
</p>
<p>
    I forgot to tell you that Mr. Kenyon was in an immoderate joy the day
    I saw him last, about Mr. Poe's 'Raven' as seen in the <i>Athenæum</i>
    extracts, and came to ask what I knew of the poet and his poetry, and
    took away the book. It's the rhythm which has taken him with 'glamour'
    I fancy. Now you will stay on Monday till the last moment, and go to
    him for dinner at six.
</p>
<p>
    Who 'looked in at the door?' Nobody. But Arabel a little way opened
    it, and hearing your voice, went back. There was no harm&mdash;<i>is</i> no fear
    of harm. Nobody in the house would find his or her pleasure in running
    the risk of giving me pain. I mean my brothers and sisters would not.
</p>
<p>
    Are you trying the music to charm the brain to stillness? Tell me. And
    keep from that 'Soul's Tragedy' which did so much harm&mdash;oh, that I had
    bound you by some Stygian oath not to touch it.
</p>
<p>
    So my rock ... may the birds drop into your crevices the seeds of all
    the flowers of the world&mdash;only it is not for <i>those</i>, that I cling to
    you as the single rock in the salt sea.

    You call me 'kind'; and by this time I have no heart to call you such

    infinitely more of you to my sense than 'dearest,' 'sweetest,' all or
    any epithets that break down with their load of honey like bees&mdash;to
    say you are 'kind,' you that so entirely and unintermittingly bless
    me,&mdash;it will never do now, 'Ba.' All the same, one way there is to
    make even 'Ba' dearer,&mdash;'<i>my</i> Ba,' I say to myself!
</p>
<p>
    About my <i>fears</i>&mdash;whether of opening doors or entering people&mdash;one
    thing is observable and prevents the possibility of any
    misconception&mdash;I desire, have been in the habit of desiring, to
    <i>increase</i> them, far from diminishing&mdash;they relate, of course,
    entirely to <i>you</i>&mdash;and only through <i>you</i> affect me the least in the
    world. Put your well-being out of the question, so far as I can
    understand it to be involved,&mdash;and the pleasure and pride I should
    immediately choose would be that the whole world knew our position.
    What pleasure, what pride! But I endeavour to remember on all
    occasions&mdash;and perhaps succeed in too few&mdash;that it is very easy for me
    to go away and leave you who cannot go. I only allude to this because
    some people are 'naturally nervous' and all that&mdash;and I am quite of
    another kind.

<p>
    Last evening I went out&mdash;having been kept at home in the afternoon to
    see somebody ... went walking for hours. I am quite well to-day and,
    now your letter comes, my Ba, most happy. And, as the sun shines, you
    are perhaps making the perilous descent now, while I write&mdash;oh, to
    meet you on the stairs! And I shall really see you on Monday, dearest?
    So soon, it ought to feel, considering the dreary weeks that now get
    to go between our days! For music, I made myself melancholy just now
    with some 'Concertos for the Harpsichord by Mr. Handel'&mdash;brought home
    by my father the day before yesterday;&mdash;what were light, modern things
    once! Now I read not very long ago a French memoir of 'Claude le
    Jeune' called in his time the Prince of Musicians,&mdash;no,
    '<i>Phoenix</i>'&mdash;the unapproachable wonder to all time&mdash;that is, twenty
    years after his death about&mdash;and to this pamphlet was prefixed as
    motto this startling axiom&mdash;'In Music, the Beau Ideal changes every
    thirty years'&mdash;well, is not that <i>true</i>? The <i>Idea</i>, mind,
    changes&mdash;the general standard ... so that it is no answer that a
    single air, such as many one knows, may strike as freshly as
    ever&mdash;they were <i>not</i> according to the Ideal of their own time&mdash;just
    now, they drop into the ready ear,&mdash;next hundred years, who will be
    the Rossini? who is no longer the Rossini even I remember&mdash;his early
    overtures are as purely Rococo as Cimarosa's or more. The sounds
    remain, keep their character perhaps&mdash;the scale's proportioned notes
    affect the same, that is,&mdash;the major third, or minor seventh&mdash;but the
    arrangement of these, the sequence the law&mdash;for them, if it <i>should</i>
    change every thirty years! To Corelli nothing seemed so conclusive in

<p>
    Now I shall know what to believe when you talk of very bad and very
    indifferent doings of yours. Dearest, I read your 'Soul's Tragedy'
    last night and was quite possessed with it, and fell finally into a
    mute wonder how you could for a moment doubt about publishing it. It
    is very vivid, I think, and vital, and impressed me more than the
    first act of 'Luria' did, though I do not mean to compare such
    dissimilar things, and for pure nobleness 'Luria' is
    unapproachable&mdash;will prove so, it seems to me. But this 'Tragedy'
    shows more heat from the first, and then, the words beat down more
    closely ... well! I am struck by it all as you see. If you keep it up
    to this passion, if you justify this high key-note, it is a great
    work, and worthy of a place next 'Luria.' Also do observe how
    excellently balanced the two will be, and how the tongue of this next
    silver Bell will swing from side to side. And <i>you</i> to frighten me
    about it. Yes, and the worst is (because it was stupid in me) the
    worst is that I half believed you and took the manuscript to be
    something inferior&mdash;for <i>you</i>&mdash;and the adviseableness of its
    publication, a doubtful case. And yet, after all, the really worst is,
    that you should prove yourself such an adept at deceiving! For can it

    even <i>my</i> ears!
</p>
<p>
    Tell me, beloved, how you are&mdash;I shall hear it to-night&mdash;shall I not?
    To think of your being unwell, and forced to go here and go there to
    visit people to whom your being unwell falls in at best among the
    secondary evils!&mdash;makes me discontented&mdash;which is one shade more to
    the uneasiness I feel. Will you take care, and not give away your life
    to these people? Because I have a better claim than they ... and shall
    put it in, if provoked ... <i>shall</i>. Then you will not use the
    shower-bath again&mdash;you promise? I dare say Mr. Kenyon observed
    yesterday how unwell you were looking&mdash;tell me if he didn't! Now do
    not work, dearest! Do not think of Chiappino, leave him behind ... he
    has a good strong life of his own, and can wait for you. Oh&mdash;but let
    me remember to say of him, that he and the other personages appear to
    me to articulate with perfect distinctness and clearness ... you need
    not be afraid of having been obscure in this first part. It is all as
    lucid as noon.
</p>
<p>
    Shall I go down-stairs to-day? 'No' say the privy-councillors,
    'because it is cold,' but I <i>shall</i> go peradventure, because the sun
    brightens and brightens, and the wind has gone round to the west.
</p>
<p>
    George had come home yesterday before you left me, but the stars were
    favourable to us and kept him out of this room. Now he is at
    Worcester&mdash;went this morning, on those never ending 'rounds,' poor
    fellow, which weary him I am sure.
</p>
<p>
    And why should music and the philosophy of it make you 'melancholy,'
    ever dearest, more than the other arts, which each has the seal of the
    age, modifying itself after a fashion and <i>to</i> one? Because it changes
    more, perhaps. Yet all the Arts are mediators between the soul and the
    Infinite, ... shifting always like a mist, between the Breath on this
    side, and the Light on that side ... shifted and coloured; mediators,
    messengers, projected from the Soul, to go and feel, for Her, <i>out
    there</i>!
</p>
<p>
    You don't call me 'kind' I confess&mdash;but then you call me 'too kind'
    which is nearly as bad, you must allow on your part. Only you were not
    in earnest when you said <i>that</i>, as it appeared afterward. <i>Were</i> you,
    yesterday, in pretending to think that I owed you nothing ... <i>I</i>?
</p>
<p>
    May God bless you. He knows that to give myself to you, is not to pay
    you. Such debts are not so paid.

<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Morning.<br>
[Post-mark, March 10, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Dear, dear Ba, if you were here I should not much <i>speak</i> to you, not
    at first&mdash;nor, indeed, at last,&mdash;but as it is, sitting alone, only
    words can be spoken, or (worse) written, and, oh how different to look
    into the eyes and imagine what <i>might</i> be said, what ought to be said,
    though it never can be&mdash;and to sit and say and write, and only imagine
    who looks above me, looks down, understanding and pardoning all! My
    love, my Ba, the fault you found once with some expressions of mine
    about the amount of imperishable pleasures already hoarded in my mind,
    the indestructible memories of you; that fault, which I refused to
    acquiesce under the imputation of, at first, you remember&mdash;well,
    <i>what</i> a fault it was, by this better light! If all stopped here and
    now; horrible! complete oblivion were the thing to be prayed for,
    rather! As it is, <i>now</i>, I must go on, must live the life out, and die
    yours. And you are doing your utmost to advance the event of
    events,&mdash;the exercise, and consequently (is it not?) necessarily
    improved sleep, and the projects for the fine days, the walking ... a
    pure bliss to think of! Well, now&mdash;I think I shall show seamanship of
    a sort, and 'try another tack'&mdash;do not be over bold, my sweetest; the
    cold <i>is</i> considerable,&mdash;taken into account the previous mildness. One
    ill-advised (I, the <i>adviser</i>, I should remember!) too early, or too
    late descent to the drawing-room, and all might be ruined,&mdash;thrown
    back so far ... seeing that our flight is to be prayed for 'not in the
    winter'&mdash;and one would be called on to wait, wait&mdash;in this world where
    nothing waits, rests, as can be counted on. Now think of this, too,
    dearest, and never mind the slowness, for the sureness' sake! How
    perfectly happy I am as you stand by me, as yesterday you stood, as
    you seem to stand now!
</p>
<p>
    I will write to-morrow more: I came home last night with a head rather
    worse; which in the event was the better, for I took a little medicine
    and all is very much improved to-day. I shall go out presently, and
    return very early and take as much care as is proper&mdash;for I thought of
    Ba, and the sublimities of Duty, and that gave myself airs of
    importance, in short, as I looked at my mother's inevitable arrow-root
    this morning. So now I am well; so now, is dearest Ba well? I shall
    hear to-night ... which will have its due effect, that circumstance,
    in quickening my retreat from Forster's Rooms. All was very pleasant
    last evening&mdash;and your letter &amp;c. went <i>à qui de droit</i>, and Mr. W.
    <i>Junior</i> had to smile good-naturedly when Mr. Burges began laying down
    this general law, that the sons of all men of genius were poor
    creatures&mdash;and Chorley and I exchanged glances after the fashion of
    two Augurs meeting at some street-corner in Cicero's time, as he says.
    And Mr. Kenyon was kind, kinder, kindest, as ever, 'and thus ends a
    wooing'!&mdash;no, a dinner&mdash;my wooing ends never, never; and so prepare
    to be asked to give, and give, and give till all is given in Heaven!
    And all I give <i>you</i> is just my heart's blessing; God bless you, my
    dearest, dearest Ba!

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, March 11, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    You find my letter I trust, for it was written this morning in time;
    and if these two lines should not be flattery ... oh, rank flattery!
    ... why happy letter is it, to help to bring you home ten minutes
    earlier, when you never ought to have left home&mdash;no, indeed! I knew
    how it would be yesterday, and how you would be worse and not better.
    You are not fit to go out, dear dearest, to sit in the glare of lights
    and talk and listen, and have the knives and forks to rattle all the
    while and remind you of the chains of necessity. Oh&mdash;should I bear it,
    do you think? I was thinking, when you went away&mdash;<i>after</i> you had
    quite gone. You would laugh to see me at my dinner&mdash;Flush and
    me&mdash;Flush placing in me such an heroic confidence, that, after he has
    cast one discriminating glance on the plate, and, in the case of
    'chicken,' wagged his tail with an emphasis, ... he goes off to the
    sofa, shuts his eyes and allows a full quarter of an hour to pass
    before he returns to take his share. Did you ever hear of a dog before
    who did not persecute one with beseeching eyes at mealtimes? And
    remember, this is not the effect of <i>discipline</i>. Also if another than
    myself happens to take coffee or break bread in the room here, he
    teazes straightway with eyes and paws, ... teazes like a common dog
    and is put out of the door before he can be quieted by scolding. But
    with <i>me</i> he is sublime! Moreover he has been a very useful dog in his
    time (in the point of capacity), causing to disappear supererogatory
    dinners and impossible breakfasts which, to do him justice, is a feat
    accomplished without an objection on his side, always.
</p>
<p>
    So, when you write me such a letter, I write back to you about Flush.
    Dearest beloved, but I have read the letter and felt it in my heart,
    through and through! and it is as wise to talk of Flush foolishly, as
    to fancy that I <i>could say how</i> it is felt ... this letter! Only when
    you spoke last of breaking off with such and such recollections, it
    was the melancholy of the breaking off which I protested against, was
    it not? and <i>not</i> the insufficiency of the recollections. There might
    have been something besides in jest. Ah, but <i>you</i> remember, if you
    please, that <i>I</i> was the first to wish (wishing for my own part, if I
    could wish exclusively) to break off in the middle the silken thread,
    and you told me, not&mdash;you forbade me&mdash;do you remember? For, as
    happiness goes, the recollections were enough, ... <i>are</i> enough for
    <i>me</i>! I mean that I should acknowledge them to be full compensation
    for the bitter gift of life, <i>such as it was</i>, to me! if that
    subject-matter were broken off here! 'Bona verba' let me speak
    nevertheless. You mean, you say, to run all risks with me, and I don't
    mean to draw back from my particular risk of ... what am I to do to
    you hereafter to make you vexed with me? What is there in marriage to
    make all these people on every side of us, (who all began, I suppose,
    by talking of love,) look askance at one another from under the silken
    mask ... and virtually hate one another through the tyranny of the
    stronger and the hypocrisy of the weaker party. It never could be so
    with <i>us</i>&mdash;<i>I know that</i>. But you grow awful to me sometimes with the
    very excess of your goodness and tenderness, and still, I think to
    myself, if you do not keep lifting me up quite off the ground by the
    strong faculty of love in you, I shall not help falling short of the
    hope you have placed in me&mdash;it must be 'supernatural' of you, to the
    end! or I fall short and disappoint you. Consider this, beloved. Now
    if I could put my soul out of my body, just to stand up before you
    and make it clear.
</p>
<p>
    I did go to the drawing-room to-day ... would ... should ... did. The
    sun came out, the wind changed ... where was the obstacle? I spent a
    quarter of an hour in a fearful solitude, listening for knocks at the
    door, as a ghost-fearer might at midnight, and 'came home' none the
    worse in any way. Be sure that I shall 'take care' better than you do,
    and there, is the worst of it all&mdash;for <i>you</i> let people make you ill,
    and do it yourself upon occasion.
</p>
<p>
    You know from my letter how I found you out in the matter of the
    'Soul's Tragedy.' Oh! so bad ... so weak, so unworthy of your name! If
    some other people were half a quarter as much the contrary!
</p>
<p>
    And so, good-night, dear dearest. In spite of my fine speeches about
    'recollections,' I should be unhappy enough to please you, with <i>only
    those</i> ... without you beside! I could not take myself back from being
</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your own&mdash;
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, March 11, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Dear, dear Ba, but indeed I <i>did</i> return home earlier by two or three
    good hours than the night before&mdash;and to find <i>no</i> letter,&mdash;none of
    yours! <i>That</i> was reserved for this morning early, and then a rest
    came, a silence, over the thoughts of you&mdash;and now again, comes this
    last note! Oh, my love&mdash;why&mdash;what is it you think to do, or become
    'afterward,' that you may fail in and so disappoint me? It is not very
    unfit that you should thus punish yourself, and that, sinning by your
    own ambition of growing something beyond my Ba even, you should 'fear'
    as you say! For, sweet, why wish, why think to alter ever by a line,
    change by a shade, turn better if that were possible, and so only rise
    the higher above me, get further from instead of nearer to my heart?
    What I expect, what I build my future on, am quite, quite prepared to
    'risk' everything for,&mdash;is that one belief that you <i>will not alter</i>,
    will just remain as you are&mdash;meaning by '<i>you</i>,' the love in you, the
    qualities I have <i>known</i> (for you will stop me, if I do not stop
    myself) what I have evidence of in every letter, in every word, every
    look. Keeping these, if it be God's will that the body passes,&mdash;what
    is that? Write no new letters, speak no new words, look no new
    looks,&mdash;only tell me, years hence that the present is alive, that what
    was once, still is&mdash;and I am, must needs be, blessed as ever! You
    speak of my feeling as if it were a pure speculation&mdash;as if because I
    <i>see somewhat</i> in you I make a calculation that there must be more to
    see somewhere or other&mdash;where bdellium is found, the onyx-stone may be
    looked for in the mystic land of the four rivers! And perhaps ... ah,
    poor human nature!&mdash;perhaps I <i>do</i> think at times on what <i>may</i> be to
    find! But what is that to you? I <i>offer</i> for the <i>bdellium</i>&mdash;the other
    may be found or not found ... what I see glitter on the ground, <i>that</i>
    will suffice to make me rich as&mdash;rich as&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    So bless you my own Ba! I would not wait for paper, and you must
    forgive half-sheets, instead of a whole celestial quire to my love and
    praise. Are you so well? So adventurous? Thank you from my heart of
    hearts. And I am quite well to-day (and have received a note from
    Procter <i>just</i> this <i>minute</i> putting off his dinner on account of the
    death of his wife's sister's husband abroad). Observe <i>this</i> sheet I
    take as I find&mdash;I mean, that the tear tells of no improper speech
    repented of&mdash;what English, what sense, what a soul's tragedy! but
    then, what real, realest love and more than love for my ever dearest
    Ba possesses her own&mdash;
</p>
<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">[Post-mark, March 12, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    When my Orpheus writes '<span title="Peri lithôn">&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota; &lambda;&iota;&theta;&omega;&nu;</span>' he makes a great mistake
    about onyxes&mdash;there is more true onyx in this letter of his that I
    have just read, than he will ever find in the desert land he goes to.
    And for what 'glitters on the ground,' it reminds me of the yellow
    metal sparks found in the Malvern Hills, and how we used to laugh
    years ago at one of our geological acquaintances, who looked
    mole-hills up that mountain-range in the scorn of his eyes, saying ...
    'Nothing but mica!!' Is anybody to be rich through 'mica', I wonder?
    through 'Nothing but mica?' 'As rich as&mdash;as rich as' ... <i>Walter the
    Pennyless</i>?
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, best you are nevertheless, and it is a sorry jest which I can
    break upon your poverty, with that golden heart of yours so
    apprehended of mine! Why if I am 'ambitious'&mdash;is it not because you
    love me as if I were worthier of your love, and that, <i>so</i>, I get
    frightened of the opening of your eyelids to the <i>un</i>worthiness? 'A
    little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
    sleep'&mdash;<i>there</i>, is my 'ambition for afterward.' Oh&mdash;you do not
    understand how with an unspeakable wonder, an astonishment which keeps
    me from drawing breath, I look to this Dream, and 'see your face as
    the face of an angel,' and fear for the vanishing, ... because dreams
    and angels <i>do</i> pass away in this world. But <i>you</i>, <i>I</i> understand
    <i>you</i>, and all your goodness past expression, past belief of mine, if
    I had not known you ... just <i>you</i>. If it will satisfy you that I
    should know you, love you, love you&mdash;why then indeed&mdash;because I never
    bowed down to any of the false gods I know the gold from the mica, ...
    I! 'My own beloved'&mdash;you should have my soul to stand on if it could
    make you stand higher. Yet you shall not call me 'ambitious.'
</p>
<p>
    To-day I went down-stairs again, and wished to know whether you were
    walking in your proportion&mdash;and your letter does call you 'better,'
    whether you walked enough or not, and it bears the Deptford post-mark.
    On Saturday I shall see how you are looking. So pale you were last
    time! I know Mr. Kenyon must have observed it, (dear Mr. Kenyon ...
    for being 'kinder and kindest') and that one of the 'augurs'
    marvelled at the other! By the way I forgot yesterday to tell you how
    Mr. Burges's 'apt remark' did amuse me. And Mr. Kenyon who said much
    the same words to me last week in relation to this very Wordsworth
    junior, writhed, I am sure, and wished the ingenious observer with the
    lost plays of Æschylus&mdash;oh, I seem to see Mr. Kenyon's face! He was to
    have come to tell me how you all behaved at dinner that day, but he
    keeps away ... you have given him too much to think of perhaps.
</p>
<p>
    I heard from Miss Mitford to-day that Mr. Chorley's hope is at an end
    in respect to the theatre, and (I must tell you) she praises him
    warmly for his philosophy and fortitude under the disappointment. How
    much philosophy does it take,&mdash;please to instruct me,&mdash;in order to the
    decent bearing of such disasters? Can I fancy one, shorter than you by
    a whole head of the soul, condescending to '<i>bear</i>' such things? No,
    indeed.
</p>
<p>
    Be good and kind, and do not work at the 'Tragedy' ... do not.
</p>
<p>
    So you and I have written out all the paper in London! At least, I
    send and send in vain to have more envelopes 'after my kind,' and the
    last answer is, that a 'fresh supply will arrive in eight days from
    Paris, and that in the meanwhile they are quite <i>out</i> in the article.'
    An awful sign of the times, is this famine of envelopes ... not to
    speak of the scarcity of little sheets:&mdash;and the augurs look to it all
    of course.
</p>
<p>
    For <i>my</i> part I think more of Chiappino&mdash;Chiappino holds me fast.
</p>
<p>
    But I must let <i>you</i> go&mdash;it is too late. This dearest letter, which
    you sent me! I thank you for it with ever so much dumbness. May God
    bless you and keep you, and make you happy for me.

</p>
<p>
    How I get to understand this much of Law&mdash;that prior possession is
    nine points of it! Just because your infinite adroitness got first
    hold of the point of view whence our connection looks like 'a dream'
    ... I find myself shut out of my very own, unable to say what is
    oftenest in my thought; whereas the dear, miraculous dream <i>you</i> were,
    and are, my Ba! Only, <i>vanish</i>&mdash;<i>that</i> you will never! My own, and for
    ever!
</p>
<p>
    Yesterday I read the poor, inconceivably inadequate notice in the
    <i>People's Journal</i>. How curiously wrong, too, in the personal guesses!
    Sad work truly. For my old friend Mrs. Adams&mdash;no, I must be silent:
    the lyrics seem doggerel in its utter purity. And so the people are to
    be instructed in the new age of gold! I <i>heard</i> two days ago precisely
    what I told you&mdash;that there was a quarrel, &amp;c. which this service was
    to smooth over, no doubt. Chorley told me, in a hasty word only, that
    all was over, Mr. Webster would not have anything to do with his play.
    The said W. is one of the poorest of poor creatures, and as Chorley
    was certainly forewarned, forearmed I will hope him to have been
    likewise&mdash;still it is very disappointing&mdash;he was apparently nearer
    than most aspirants to the prize,&mdash;having the best will of the
    actresses on whose shoulder the burthen was to lie. I hope they have
    been quite honest with him&mdash;knowing as I do the easy process of
    transferring all sorts of burthens, in that theatrical world, from
    responsible to irresponsible members of it, actors to manager, manager
    to actors, as the case requires. And it is a 'hope deferred' with
    Chorley; not for the second or third time. I am very glad that he
    cares no more than you tell me.
</p>
<p>
    Still you go down-stairs, and still return safely, and every step
    leads us nearer to <i>my</i> 'hope.' How unremittingly you bless me&mdash;a
    visit promises a letter, a letter brings such news, crowns me with
    such words, and speaks of another visit&mdash;and so the golden links
    extend. Dearest words, dearest letters&mdash;as I add each to my heap, I
    say&mdash;I <i>do</i> say&mdash;'I was <i>poor</i>, it now seems, a minute ago, when I had
    not <i>this</i>!' Bless you, dear, dear Ba. On Saturday I shall be with
    you, I trust&mdash;may God bless you! Ever your own

<br>
<h3><i>E.B.B. to R.B.</i> </h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday.<br>
[Post-mark, March 16, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Ever dearest I am going to say one word first of all lest I should
    forget it afterward, of the two or three words which you said
    yesterday and so passingly that you probably forget to-day having said
    them at all. We were speaking of Mr. Chorley and his house, and you
    said that you did not care for such and such things for yourself, but
    that for others&mdash;now you remember the rest. And I just want to say
    what it would have been simpler to have said at the time&mdash;only not so
    easy&mdash;(I <i>couldn't</i> say it at the time) that you are not if you please
    to fancy that because I am a woman I have not the pretension to do
    with as little in any way as you yourself ... no, it is not <i>that</i> I
    mean to say.... I mean that you are not, if you please, to fancy that,
    because I am a woman, I look to be cared for in those outside things,
    or should have the slightest pleasure in any of them. So never wish
    nor regret in your thoughts to be able or not to be able to care this
    and this for <i>me</i>; for while you are thinking so, our thoughts go
    different ways, which is wrong. Mr. Fox did me a great deal too much
    honour in calling me 'a religious hermit'; he was 'curiously' in
    fault, as you saw. It is not my vocation to sit on a stone in a
    cave&mdash;I was always too fond of lolling upon sofas or in chairs nearly
    as large,&mdash;and this, which I sit in, was given to me when I was a
    child by my uncle, the uncle I spoke of to you once, and has been
    lolled in nearly ever since ... when I was well enough. Well&mdash;<i>that</i>
    is a sort of luxury, of course&mdash;but it is more idle than expensive, as
    a habit, and I do believe that it is the 'head and foot of my
    offending' in that matter. Yes&mdash;'confiteor tibi' besides, that I do
    hate white dimity curtains, which is highly improper for a religious
    hermit of course, but excusable in <i>me</i> who would accept brown serge
    as a substitute with ever so much indifference. It is the white light
    which comes in the dimity which is so hateful to me. To 'go mad in
    white dimity' seems perfectly natural, and consequential even. Set
    aside these foibles, and one thing is as good as another with me, and
    the more simplicity in the way of living, the better. If I saw Mr.
    Chorley's satin sofas and gilded ceilings I should call them very
    pretty I dare say, but never covet the possession of the like&mdash;it
    would never enter my mind to do so. Then Papa has not kept a carriage
    since I have been grown up (they grumble about it here in the house,
    but when people have once had great reverses they get nervous about
    spending money) so I shall not miss the Clarence and greys ... and I
    do entreat you <i>not</i> to put those two ideas together again of <i>me</i> and
    the finery which has nothing to do with me. I have talked a great deal
    too much of all this, you will think, but I want you, once for all, to
    apply it broadly to the whole of the future both in the general view
    and the details, so that we need not return to the subject. Judge for
    me as for yourself&mdash;<i>what is good for you is good for me</i>. Otherwise I
    shall be humiliated, you know; just as far as I know your thoughts.

    Mr. Kenyon has been here to-day&mdash;and I have been down-stairs&mdash;two
    great events! He was in brilliant spirits and sate talking ever so
    long, and named you as he always does. Something he asked, and then
    said suddenly ... 'But I don't see why I should ask <i>you</i>, when I
    ought to know him better than you can.' On which I was wise enough to
    change colour, as I felt, to the roots of my hair. There is the
    effect of a bad conscience! and it has happened to me before, with Mr.
    Kenyon, three times&mdash;once particularly, when I could have cried with
    vexation (to complete the effects!), he looked at me with such
    infinite surprise in a dead pause of any speaking. <i>That</i> was in the
    summer; and all to be said for it now, is, that it couldn't be helped:
    couldn't!
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon asked of 'Saul.' (By the way, you never answered about the
    blue lilies.) He asked of 'Saul' and whether it would be finished in
    the new number. He hangs on the music of your David. Did you read in
    the <i>Athenæum</i> how Jules Janin&mdash;no, how the critic on Jules Janin (was
    it the critic? was it Jules Janin? the glorious confusion is gaining
    on me I think) has magnificently confounded places and persons in
    Robert Southey's urn by the Adriatic and devoted friendship for Lord
    Byron? And immediately the English observer of the phenomenon, after
    moralizing a little on the crass ignorance of Frenchmen in respect to
    our literature, goes on to write like an ignoramus himself, on Mme.
    Charles Reybaud, encouraging that pure budding novelist, who is in
    fact a hack writer of romances third and fourth rate, of questionable
    purity enough, too. It does certainly appear wonderful that we should
    not sufficiently stand abreast here in Europe, to justify and
    necessitate the establishment of an European review&mdash;journal
    rather&mdash;(the 'Foreign Review,' so called, touching only the summits of
    the hills) a journal which might be on a level with the intelligent
    readers of all the countries of Europe, and take all the rising
    reputations of each, with the national light on them as they rise,
    into observation and judgment. If nobody can do this, it is a pity I
    think to do so much less&mdash;both in France and England&mdash;to snatch up a
    French book from over the Channel as ever and anon they do in the
    <i>Athenæum</i>, and say something prodigiously absurd of it, till people
    cry out 'oh oh' as in the House of Commons.
</p>
<p>
    Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;and how wise I am to-day, as if I were a critic myself!
    Yesterday I was foolish instead&mdash;for I couldn't get out of my head all
    the evening how you said that you would come 'to see a candle held up
    at the window.' Well! but I do not mean to love you any more just
    now&mdash;so I tell you plainly. Certainly I will not. I love you already
    too much perhaps. I feel like the turning Dervishes turning in the sun
    when you say such words to me&mdash;and I <i>never shall</i> love you any
    'less,' because it is too much to be made less of.
</p>
<p>
    And you write to-morrow? and will tell me how you are? honestly will
    tell me? May God bless you, most dear!

[Post-mark, March 16, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    How will the love my heart is full of for you, let me be silent?
    Insufficient speech is better than no speech, in one regard&mdash;the
    speaker had <i>tried</i> words, and if they fail, hereafter he needs not
    reflect that he did not even try&mdash;so with me now, that loving you, Ba,
    with all my heart and soul, all my senses being lost in one wide
    wondering gratitude and veneration, I press close to you to say so, in
    this imperfect way, my dear dearest beloved! Why do you not help me,
    rather than take my words, my proper word, from me and call them
    yours, when yours they are not? You said lately love of you 'made you
    humble'&mdash;just as if to hinder <i>me</i> from saying that earnest
    truth!&mdash;entirely true it is, as I feel ever more convincingly. You do
    not choose to understand it should be so, nor do I much care, for the
    one thing you must believe, must resolve to believe in its length and
    breadth, is that I do love you and live only in the love of you.
</p>
<p>
    I will rest on the confidence that you do so believe! You <i>know</i> by
    this that it is no shadowy image of you and <i>not</i> you, which having
    attached myself to in the first instance, I afterward compelled my
    fancy to see reproduced, so to speak, with tolerable exactness to the
    original idea, in you, the dearest real <i>you</i> I am blessed with&mdash;you
    <i>know</i> what the eyes are to me, and the lips and the hair. And I, for
    my part, know <i>now</i>, while fresh from seeing you, certainly <i>know</i>,
    whatever I may have said a short time since, that <i>you</i> will go on to
    the end, that the arm round me will not let me go,&mdash;over such a blind
    abyss&mdash;I refuse to think, to fancy, <i>towards</i> what it would be to
    loose you now! So I give my life, my soul into your hand&mdash;the giving
    is a mere form too, it is yours, ever yours from the first&mdash;but ever
    as I see you, sit with you, and come away to think over it all, I find
    more that seems mine to give; you give me more life and it goes back
    to you.
</p>
<p>
    I shall hear from you to-morrow&mdash;then, I will go out early and get
    done with some calls, in the joy and consciousness of what waits me,
    and when I return I will write a few words. Are these letters, these
    merest attempts at getting to talk with you through the distance&mdash;yet
    always with the consolation of feeling that you will know all,
    interpret all and forgive it and put it right&mdash;can such things be
    cared for, expected, as you say? Then, Ba, my life <i>must</i> be better
    ... with the closeness to help, and the 'finding out the way' for
    which love was always noted. If you begin making in fancy a lover to
    your mind, I am lost at once&mdash;but the one quality of <i>affection</i> for
    you, which would sooner or later have to be placed on his list of
    component graces; <i>that</i> I will dare start supply&mdash;the entire love you
    could dream of <i>is</i> here. You think you see some of the other
    adornments, and only too many; and you will see plainer one day, but
    with that I do not concern myself&mdash;you shall admire the true
    heroes&mdash;but me you shall love for the love's sake. Let me kiss you,
    you, my dearest, dearest&mdash;God bless you ever&mdash;

<p>
    Indeed I would, dearest Ba, go with entire gladness and pride to see a
    light that came from your room&mdash;why should that surprise you? Well,
    you will <i>know</i> one day.
</p>
<p>
    We understand each other too about the sofas and gilding&mdash;oh, I know
    you, my own sweetest! For me, if I had set those matters to heart, I
    should have turned into the obvious way of getting them&mdash;not <i>out</i> of
    it, as I did resolutely from the beginning. All I meant was, to
    express a very natural feeling&mdash;if one could give you diamonds for
    flowers, and if you liked diamonds,&mdash;then, indeed! As it is, wherever
    we are found shall be, if you please, 'For the love's sake found
    therein&mdash;sweetest <i>house</i> was ever seen!'
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kenyon must be merciful. Lilies are of all colours in
    Palestine&mdash;one sort is particularized as <i>white</i> with a dark blue spot
    and streak&mdash;the water lily, lotos, which I think I meant, is <i>blue</i>
    altogether.
</p>
<p>
    I have walked this morning to town and back&mdash;I feel much better,
    'honestly'! The head better&mdash;the spirits rising&mdash;as how should they
    not, when <i>you</i> think all will go well in the end, when you write to
    me that you go down-stairs and are stronger&mdash;and when the rest is
    written?
</p>
<p>
    Not more now, dearest, for time is pressing, but you will answer
    this,&mdash;the love that is not here,&mdash;not the idle words, and I will
    reply to-morrow. Thursday is so far away yet!
</p>
<p>
    Bless you, my very own, only dearest!

<p style="text-align: right">Monday Evening.<br>
[Post-mark, March 17, 1846.]
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, you are dearest always! Talk of Sirens, ... there must be
    some masculine ones 'rari nantes,' I fancy, (though we may not find
    them in unquestionable authorities like your Ælian!) to justify this
    voice I hear. Ah, how you speak, with that pretension, too, to
    dumbness! What should people be made of, in order to bear such words,
    do you think? Will all the wax from all the altar-candles in the
    Sistine Chapel, keep the piercing danger from their ears? Being tied
    up a good deal tighter than Ulysses did not save <i>me</i>. Dearest
    dearest: I laugh, you see, as usual, not to cry! But deep down, deeper
    than the Sirens go, deep underneath the tides, <i>there</i>, I bless and
    love you with the voice that makes no sound.
</p>
<p>
    Other human creatures (how often I do think it to myself!) have their
    good things scattered over their lives, sown here and sown there, down
    the slopes, and by the waysides. But with me ... I have mine all
    poured down on one spot in the midst of the sands!&mdash;if you knew what I
    feel at moments, and at half-hours, when I give myself up to the
    feeling freely and take no thought of red eyes. A woman once was
    killed with gifts, crushed with the weight of golden bracelets thrown
    at her: and, knowing myself, I have wondered more than a little, how
    it was that I could <i>bear</i> this strange and unused gladness, without
    sinking as the emotion rose. Only I was incredulous at first, and the
    day broke slowly ... and the gifts fell like the rain ... softly; and
    God gives strength, by His providence, for sustaining blessings as
    well as stripes. Dearest&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    For the rest I understand you perfectly&mdash;perfectly. It was simply to
    your <i>thoughts</i>, that I replied ... and that you need not say to
    yourself any more, as you did once to me when you brought me flowers,
    that you wished they were diamonds. It was simply to prevent the
    accident of such a <i>thought</i>, that I spoke out mine. You would not
    wish accidentally that you had a double-barrelled gun to give me, or a
    cardinal's hat, or a snuff box, and I meant to say that you <i>might as
    well</i>&mdash;as diamonds and satin sofas à la Chorley. Thoughts are
    something, and <i>your</i> thoughts are something more. To be sure they
    are!
</p>
<p>
    You are better you say, which makes me happy of course. And you will
    not make the 'better' worse again by doing wrong things&mdash;<i>that</i> is my
    petition. It was the excess of goodness to write those two letters for
    me in one day, and I thank you, thank you. Beloved, when you write,
    <i>let</i> it be, if you choose, ever so few lines. Do not suffer me (for
    my own sake) to tire you, because two lines or three bring <i>you</i> to me
    ... remember ... just as a longer letter would.
</p>
<p>
    But where, pray, did I say, and when, that 'everything would end
    well?' Was <i>that</i> in the dream, when we two met on the stairs? I did
    not really say so I think. And 'well' is how you understand it. If you
    jump out of the window you succeed in getting to the ground, somehow,
    dead or alive ... but whether <i>that</i> means 'ending well,' depends on
    your way of considering matters. I am seriously of opinion
    nevertheless, that if 'the arm,' you talk of, <i>drops</i>, it will not be
    for weariness nor even for weakness, but because it is cut off at the
    shoulder. <i>I</i> will not fail to you,&mdash;may God so deal with me, so bless
    me, so leave me, as I live only for you and <i>shall</i>. Do you doubt
    <i>that</i>, my only beloved! Ah, you know well&mdash;<i>too well</i>, people would
    say ... but I do not think it 'too well' myself, ... knowing <i>you</i>.

    Here is a gossip which Mr. Kenyon brought me on Sunday&mdash;disbelieving
    it himself, he asseverated, though Lady Chantrey said it 'with
    authority,'&mdash;that Mr. Harness had offered his hand heart and
    ecclesiastical dignities to Miss Burdett Coutts. It is Lady Chantrey's
    and Mr. Kenyon's <i>secret</i>, remember.
</p>
<p>
    And ... will you tell me? How can a man spend four or five successive
    months on the sea, most cheaply&mdash;at the least pecuniary expense, I
    mean? Because Miss Mitford's friend Mr. Buckingham is ordered by his
    medical adviser to complete his cure by these means; and he is not
    rich. Could he go with sufficient comfort by a merchant's vessel to
    the Mediterranean ... and might he drift about among the Greek
    islands?

<p>
    'Out of window' would be well, as I see the leap, if it ended (<i>so far
    as I am concerned</i>) in the worst way imaginable&mdash;I would I 'run the
    risk' (Ba's other word) rationally, deliberately,&mdash;knowing what the
    ordinary law of chances in this world justifies in such a case; and if
    the result after all <i>was</i> unfortunate, it would be far easier to
    undergo the extremest penalty with so little to reproach myself
    for,&mdash;than to put aside the adventure,&mdash;waive the wondrous probability
    of such best fortune, in a fear of the barest possibility of an
    adverse event, and so go to my grave, Walter the Penniless, with an
    eternal recollection that Miss Burdett Coutts once offered to wager
    sundry millions with me that she could throw double-sixes a dozen
    times running&mdash;which wager I wisely refused to accept because it was
    not written in the stars that such a sequence might never be. I had
    rather, rather a thousand-fold lose my paltry stake, and be the one
    recorded victim to such an unexampled unluckiness that half a dozen
    mad comets, suns gone wrong, and lunatic moons must have come
    laboriously into conjunction for my special sake to bring it to pass,
    which were no slight honour, properly considered!&mdash;And this is <i>my</i>
    way of laughing, dearest Ba, when the excess of belief in you, and
    happiness with you, runs over and froths if it don't
    sparkle&mdash;underneath is a deep, a sea not to be moved. But chance,
    chance! there is <i>no</i> chance here! I <i>have</i> gained enough for my life,
    I can only put in peril the gaining more than enough. You shall change
    altogether my dear, dearest love, and I will be happy to the last
    minute on what I can remember of this past year&mdash;I <i>could</i> do that.
    <i>Now</i>, jump with me out, Ba! If you feared for yourself&mdash;all would be
    different, sadly different&mdash;But saying what you do say, promising 'the
    strength of arm'&mdash;do not wonder that I call it an assurance of all
    being 'well'! All is <i>best</i>, as you promise&mdash;dear, darling Ba!&mdash;and I
    say, in my degree, with all the energy of my nature, <i>as you say</i>,
    promise as you promise&mdash;only meaning a worship of you that is solely
    fit for me, fit by position&mdash;are not you my 'mistress?' Come, some
    good out of those old conventions, in which you lost faith after the
    Bower's disappearance, (it was carried by the singing angels, like the
    house at Loretto, to the Siren's isle where we shall find it preserved
    in a beauty 'very rare and absolute')&mdash;is it not right you should be
    my Lady, my Queen? and you are, and ever must be, dear Ba. Because I
    am suffered to kiss the lips, shall I ever refuse to embrace the feet?
    and kiss lips, and embrace feet, love you <i>wholly</i>, my Ba! May God
    bless you&mdash;

    It would be easy for Mr. Buckingham to find a Merchant-ship bound for
    some Mediterranean port, after a week or two in harbour, to another
    and perhaps a third&mdash;Naples, Palermo, Syra, Constantinople, and so on.
    The expense would be very trifling, but the want of comfort <i>enormous</i>
    for an invalid&mdash;the one advantage is the solitariness of the <i>one</i>
    passenger among all those rough new creatures. <i>I</i> like it much, and
    soon get deep into their friendship, but another has other ways of
    viewing matters. No one article provided by the ship in the way of
    provisions can anybody touch. Mr. B. must lay in his own stock, and
    the horrors of dirt and men's ministry are portentous, yet by a little
    arrangement beforehand much might be done. Still, I only know my own
    powers of endurance, and counsel nobody to gain my experience. On the
    other hand, were all to do again, I had rather have seen Venice <i>so</i>,
    with the five or six weeks' absolute rest of the mind's eyes, than any
    other imaginable way,&mdash;except Balloon-travelling.

    Do you think they meant Landor's 'Count Julian'&mdash;the 'subject of his

<p>
    Ah well&mdash;we shall see. Only remember that it is not my fault if I
    throw the double sixes, and if you, on [<i>some sun-shiny</i> day, (a day
    too late to help yourself) stand face to face with a milkwhite
    unicorn.]<b><a href="#note-26">26</a></b> Ah&mdash;do not be angry. It is ungrateful of me to write
    so&mdash;I put a line through it to prove I have a conscience after all. I
    know that you love me, and I know it so well that I was reproaching
    myself severely not long ago, for seeming to love your love more than
    you. Let me tell you how I proved <i>that</i>, or seemed. For ever so long,
    you remember, I have been talking finely about giving you up for your
    good and so on. Which was sincere as far as the words went&mdash;but oh,
    the hypocrisy of our souls!&mdash;of mine, for instance! 'I would give you
    up for your good'&mdash;<i>but</i> when I pressed upon myself the question
    whether (if I had the power) I would consent to make you willing to be
    given up, by throwing away your love into the river, in a ring like
    Charlemagne's, ... why I found directly that I would throw myself
    there sooner. I could not do it in fact&mdash;I shrank from the test. A
    very pitiful virtue of generosity, is your Ba's! Still, it is not
    possible, I think, that she should '<i>love your love more than you</i>.'
    There must be a mistake in the calculation somewhere&mdash;a figure dropt.
    It would be too bad for her!
</p>
<p>
    Your account of your merchantmen, though with Venice in the distance,
    will scarcely be attractive to a confirmed invalid, I fear&mdash;and yet
    the steamers will be found expensive beyond his means. The
    sugar-vessels, which I hear most about, give out an insufferable smell
    and steam&mdash;let us talk of it a little on Thursday. On Monday I forgot.
</p>
<p>
    For Landor's 'Julian,' oh no, I cannot fancy it to be probable that
    those Parisians should know anything of Landor, even by a mistake. Do
    you not suppose that the play is founded (confounded) on Shelley's
    poem, as the French use materials ... by distraction, into confusion?
    The 'urn by the Adriatic' (which all the French know how to turn
    upside down) fixes the reference to Shelley&mdash;does it not?
</p>
<p>
    Not a word of the head&mdash;what does <i>that</i> mean, I wonder. I have not
    been down-stairs to-day&mdash;the wind is too cold&mdash;but you have walked?
    ... there was no excuse for you. God bless you, ever dearest. It is my
    last word till Thursday's first. A fine queen you have, by the way!&mdash;a

<p>
    I shall be late with my letter this morning because my sisters have
    been here talking, talking ... and I did not like to say exactly 'Go
    away that I may write.' Mr. Kenyon shortened our time yesterday too by
    a whole half-hour or three quarters&mdash;the stars are against us. He is
    coming on Sunday, however, he says, and if so, Monday will be safe and
    clear&mdash;and not a word was said after you went, about you: he was in a
    good joyous humour, as you saw, and the letter he brought was, oh! so
    complimentary to me&mdash;I will tell you. The writer doesn't see anything
    'in Browning and Turner,' she confesses&mdash;'<i>may</i> perhaps with time and
    study,' but for the present sees nothing,&mdash;only has wide-open eyes of
    admiration for E.B.B. ... now isn't it satisfactory to <i>me</i>? Do you
    understand the full satisfaction of just that sort of thing ... to be
    praised by somebody who sees nothing in Shakespeare?&mdash;to be found on
    the level of somebody so flat? Better the bad-word of the Britannia,
    ten times over! And best, to take no thought of bad or good words! ...
    except such as I shall have to-night, perhaps! Shall I?
</p>
<p>
    Will you be pleased to understand in the meanwhile a little about the
    'risks' I am supposed to run, and not hold to such a godlike
    simplicity ('gods and bulls,' dearest!) as you made show of yesterday?
    If we two went to the gaming-table, and you gave me a purse of gold to
    play with, should I have a right to talk proudly of 'my stakes?' and
    would any reasonable person say of both of us playing together as
    partners, that we ran 'equal risks'? I trow not&mdash;and so do <i>you</i> ...
    when you have not predetermined to be stupid, and mix up the rouge and
    noir into 'one red' of glorious confusion. What had I to lose on the
    point of happiness when you knew me first?&mdash;and if now I lose (as I
    certainly may according to your calculation) the happiness you have
    given me, why still I am your debtor for <i>the gift</i> ... now see! Yet
    to bring you down into my ashes ... <i>that</i> has been so intolerable a
    possibility to me from the first. Well, perhaps I run <i>more</i> risk than
    you, under that one aspect. Certainly I never should forgive myself
    again if you were unhappy. 'What had <i>I</i> to do,' I should think, 'with
    touching your life?' And if ever I am to think so, I would rather that
    I never had known you, seen your face, heard your voice&mdash;which is the
    uttermost sacrifice and abnegation. I could not say or sacrifice any
    more&mdash;not even for <i>you</i>! <i>You</i>, for <i>you</i> ... is all I can!
</p>
<p>
    Since you left me I have been making up my mind to your having the
    headache worse than ever, through the agreement with Moxon. I do, do
    beseech you to spare yourself, and let 'Luria' go as he is, and above
    all things not to care for my infinite foolishnesses as you see them
    in those notes. Remember that if you are ill, it is not so easy to
    say, 'Now I will be well again.' Ever dearest, care for me in
    yourself&mdash;say how you are.... I am not unwell to-day, but feel flagged
    and weak rather with the cold ... and look at your flowers for courage
    and an assurance that the summer is within hearing. May God bless you
    ... blessing <i>us</i>, beloved!

<p>
    Dearest,&mdash;it just strikes me that I <i>might</i> by some chance be kept in
    town this morning&mdash;(having to go to Milnes' breakfast there)&mdash;so as
    not to find the note I venture to expect, in time for an answer by our
    last post to-night. But I will try&mdash;this only is a precaution against
    the possibility. Dear, dear Ba! I cannot thank you, know not how to
    thank you for the notes! I adopt every one, of course, not as Ba's
    notes but as Miss Barrett's, not as Miss Barrett's but as anybody's,
    everybody's&mdash;such incontestable improvements they suggest. When shall
    I tell you more ... on Monday or Tuesday? <i>That</i> I <i>must</i>
    know&mdash;because you appointed Monday, 'if nothing happened&mdash;' and Mr. K.
    happened&mdash;can you let me hear by our early post to-morrow&mdash;as on
    Monday I am to be with Moxon early, you know&mdash;and no letters arrive
    before 11-1/2 or 12. I was not very well yesterday, but to-day am much
    better&mdash;and you,&mdash;I say how <i>I</i> am precisely to have a double right to
    know <i>all</i> about you, dearest, in this snow and cold! How do you bear
    it? And Mr. K. spoke of '<i>that</i> being your worst day.' Oh, dear
    dearest Ba, remember how I live in you&mdash;on the hopes, with the memory
    of you. Bless you ever!

    I do not understand how my letters limp so instead of flying as they
    ought with the feathers I give them, and how you did not receive last
    night, nor even early this morning, what left me at two o'clock
    yesterday. But I understand <i>now</i> the not hearing from you&mdash;you were
    not well. Not well, not well ... <i>that</i> is always 'happening' at
    least. And Mr. Moxon, who is to have his first sheet, whether you are
    well or ill! It is wrong ... yes, very wrong&mdash;and if one point of
    wrongness is touched, we shall not easily get right again&mdash;as I think
    mournfully, feeling confident (call me Cassandra, but I cannot jest
    about it) feeling certain that it will end (the means being so
    persisted in) by some serious illness&mdash;serious sorrow,&mdash;on yours and
    my part.
</p>
<p>
    As to Monday, Mr. Kenyon said he would come again on Sunday&mdash;in which
    case, Monday will be clear. If he should not come on Sunday, he will
    or may on Monday,&mdash;yet&mdash;oh, in every case, perhaps you can come on
    Monday&mdash;there will be no time to let you know of Mr. Kenyon&mdash;and
    <i>probably</i> we shall be safe, and your being in town seems to fix the
    day. For myself I am well enough, and the wind has changed, which will
    make me better&mdash;this cold weather oppresses and weakens me, but it is
    close to April and can't last and won't last&mdash;it is warmer already.
    Beware of the notes! They are not Ba's&mdash;except for the insolence, nor
    EBB's&mdash;because of the carelessness. If I had known, moreover, that you
    were going to Moxon's on Monday, they should have gone to the fire
    rather than provoked you into superfluous work for the short interval.
    Just so much are they despised of both EBB and Ba.
</p>
<p>
    I am glad I did not hear from you yesterday because you were not
    well, and you <i>must never</i> write when you are not well. But if you had
    been quite well, should I have heard?&mdash;<i>I doubt it</i>. You meant me to
    hear from you only once, from Thursday to Monday. Is it not the truth
    now that you hate writing to me?
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Athenæum</i> takes up the 'Tales from Boccaccio' as if they were
    worth it, and imputes in an underground way the authorship to the
    members of the 'coterie' so called&mdash;do you observe <i>that</i>? There is an
    implication that persons named in the poem wrote the poem themselves.
    And upon <i>whom</i> does the critic mean to fix the song of 'Constancy'
    ... the song which is 'not to puzzle anybody' who knows the tunes of
    the song-writers! The perfection of commonplace it seems to me. It
    might have been written by the 'poet Bunn.' Don't you think so?
</p>
<p>
    While I write this you are in town, but you will not read it till
    Sunday unless I am more fortunate than usual. On Monday then! And no
    word before? No&mdash;I shall be sure not to hear to-night. Now do try not
    to suffer through 'Luria.' Let Mr. Moxon wait a week rather. There is
    time enough.

<p>
    Oh, my Ba&mdash;how you shall hear of this to-morrow&mdash;that is all: <i>I</i> hate
    writing? See when presently I <i>only</i> write to you daily, hourly if you
    let me? Just this <i>now</i>&mdash;I will be with you to-morrow in any case&mdash;I
    can go away <i>at once</i>, if need be, or stay&mdash;if you like you can stop
    me by sending a note for me <i>to Moxon's before</i> 10 o'clock&mdash;if
    anything calls for such a measure.
</p>
<p>
    Now briefly,&mdash;I am unwell and entirely irritated with this sad
    'Luria'&mdash;I thought it a failure at first, I find it infinitely worse
    than I thought&mdash;it is a pure exercise of <i>cleverness</i>, even where most
    successful; clever attempted reproduction of what was conceived by
    another faculty, and foolishly let pass away. If I go on, even hurry
    the more to get on, with the printing,&mdash;it is to throw out and away
    from me the irritating obstruction once and forever. I have corrected
    it, cut it down, and it may stand and pledge me to doing better
    hereafter. I say, too, in excuse to myself, <i>unlike</i> the woman at her
    spinning-wheel, 'He thought of his <i>flax</i> on the whole far more than
    of his singing'&mdash;more of his life's sustainment, of dear, dear Ba he
    hates writing to, than of these wooden figures&mdash;no wonder all is as it
    is?
</p>
<p>
    Here is a pure piece of the old Chorley leaven for you, just as it
    reappears ever and anon and throws one back on the mistrust all but
    abandoned! Chorley <i>knows</i> I have not seen that Powell for nearly
    fifteen months&mdash;that I never heard of the book till it reached me in a
    blank cover&mdash;that I never contributed a line or word to it directly or
    indirectly&mdash;and I should think he <i>also knows</i> that all the sham
    learning, notes &amp;c., all that saves the book from the deepest deep of
    contempt, was contributed by Heraud (<i>a regular critic in the
    'Athenæum'</i>), who received his pay for the same: he knows I never
    spoke in my life to 'Jones or Stephens'&mdash;that there is no 'coterie' of
    which I can, by any extension of the word, form a part&mdash;that I am in
    this case at the mercy of a wretched creature who to get into my
    favour again (to speak the plain truth) put in the gross, disgusting
    flattery in the notes&mdash;yet Chorley, knowing this, none so well, and
    what the writer's end is&mdash;(to have it supposed I, and the others
    named&mdash;Talfourd, for instance&mdash;<SPAN class="sc-ex">are</span> his friends and helpers)&mdash;he
    condescends to <i>further</i> it by such a notice, written with that
    observable and characteristic duplicity, that to poor gross stupid
    Powell it shall look like an admiring 'Oh, fie&mdash;<i>so</i> clever but <i>so</i>
    wicked'!&mdash;a kind of <i>D'Orsay's</i> praise&mdash;while to the rest of his
    readers, a few depreciatory epithets&mdash;slight sneers convey his real
    sentiments, he trusts! And this he does, just because Powell buys an
    article of him once a quarter and would <i>expect</i> notice. I think I
    hear Chorley&mdash;'You know, I <i>cannot</i> praise such a book&mdash;it <i>is</i> too
    bad'&mdash;as if, as if&mdash;oh, it makes one sicker than having written
    'Luria,' there's one comfort! I shall call on Chorley and ask for
    <i>his</i> account of the matter. Meantime nobody will read his foolish
    notice without believing as he and Powell desire! Bless you, my own
    Ba&mdash;to-morrow makes amends to R.B.

</p>
<p>
    How ungrateful I was to your flowers yesterday, never looking at them
    nor praising them till they were put away, and yourself gone away&mdash;and
    <i>that</i> was <i>your</i> fault, be it remembered, because you began to tell
    me of the good news from Moxon's, and, in the joy of it, I missed the
    flowers ... for the nonce, you know. Afterward they had their due, and
    all the more that you were not there. My first business when you are
    out of the room and the house, and the street perhaps, is to arrange
    the flowers and to gather out of them all the thoughts you leave
    between the leaves and at the end of the stalks. And shall I tell you
    what happened, not yesterday, but the Thursday before? no, it was the
    Friday morning, when I found, or rather Wilson found and held up from
    my chair, a bunch of dead blue violets. Quite dead they seemed! You
    had dropped them and I had sate on them, and where we murdered them
    they had lain, poor things, all the night through. And Wilson thought
    it the vainest of labours when she saw me set about reviving them,
    cutting the stalks afresh, and dipping them head and ears into
    water&mdash;but then she did not know how you, and I, and ours, live under
    a miraculous dispensation, and could only simply be astonished when
    they took to blowing again as if they never had wanted the dew of the
    garden, ... yes, and when at last they outlived all the prosperity of
    the contemporary white violets which flourished in water from the
    beginning, and were free from the disadvantage of having been sate
    upon. Now you shall thank me for this letter, it is at once so amusing
    and instructive. After all, too, it teaches you what the great events
    of my life are, not that the resuscitation of your violets would not
    really be a great event to me, even if I led the life of a pirate,
    between fire and sea, otherwise. But take <i>you</i> away ... out of my
    life!&mdash;and what remains? The only greenness I used to have (before you
    brought your flowers) was as the grass growing in deserted streets,
    ... which brings a proof, in every increase, of the extending
    desolation.
</p>
<p>
    Dearest, I persist in thinking that you ought not to be too disdainful
    to explain your meaning in the Pomegranates. Surely you might say in a
    word or two that, your title having been doubted about (to your
    surprise, you <i>might</i> say!), you refer the doubters to the Jewish
    priest's robe, and the Rabbinical gloss ... for I suppose it is a
    gloss on the robe ... do you not think so? Consider that Mr. Kenyon
    and I may fairly represent the average intelligence of your
    readers,&mdash;and that <i>he</i> was altogether in the clouds as to your
    meaning ... had not the most distant notion of it,&mdash;while I, taking
    hold of the priest's garment, missed the Rabbins and the distinctive
    significance, as completely as he did. Then for Vasari, it is not the
    handbook of the whole world, however it may be Mrs. Jameson's. Now why
    should you be too proud to teach such persons as only desire to be
    taught? I persist&mdash;I shall teaze you.
</p>
<p>
    This morning my brothers have been saying ... 'Ah you had Mr. Browning
    with you yesterday, I see by the flowers,' ... just as if they said 'I
    see queen Mab has been with you.' Then Stormie took the opportunity of
    swearing to me by all his gods that your name was mentioned lately in
    the House of Commons&mdash;<i>is</i> that true? or untrue? He forgot to tell me
    at the time, he says,&mdash;and you were named with others and in relation
    to copyright matters. <i>Is</i> it true?
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Hornblower Gill is the author of a Hymn to Passion week, and wrote
    to me as the 'glorifier of pain!' to remind me that the best glory of
    a soul is shown in the joy of it, and that all chief poets except
    Dante have seen, felt, and written it so. Thus and therefore was
    matured his purpose of writing an 'ode to joy,' as I told you. The man
    seems to have very good thoughts, ... but he writes like a colder
    Cowley still ... no impulse, no heat for fusing ... no inspiration, in
    fact. Though I have scarcely done more than glance at his 'Passion
    week,' and have little right to give an opinion.
</p>

    My own dearest, if you <i>do</i>&mdash;(for I confess to nothing of the kind),
    but if you <i>should</i> detect an unwillingness to write at certain times,
    what would that prove,&mdash;I mean, what that one need shrink from
    avowing? If I never had you before me except when writing letters to
    you&mdash;then! Why, we do not even <i>talk</i> much now! witness Mr. Buckingham
    and his voyage that ought to have been discussed!&mdash;Oh, how coldly I
    should write,&mdash;how the bleak-looking paper would seem unpropitious to
    carry my feeling&mdash;if all had to begin and try to find words <i>this</i>
    way!
</p>
<p>
    Now, this morning I have been out&mdash;to town and back&mdash;and for all the
    walking my head aches&mdash;and I have the conviction that presently when I
    resign myself to think of you wholly, with only the pretext,&mdash;the
    make-believe of occupation, in the shape of some book to turn over the
    leaves of,&mdash;I shall see you and soon be well; so soon! You must know,

    stands just in the same relation to this chair I sit on now, that

    But I have set my heart on <i>seeing</i> it&mdash;will you remember next time,
    next Saturday?

<p>
    I will leave off now. To-morrow, dearest, only dearest Ba, I will
    write a longer letter&mdash;the clock stops it this afternoon&mdash;it is later
    than I thought, and our poor crazy post! This morning, hoping against
    hope, I ran to meet our postman coming meditatively up the lane&mdash;with

    Ah; if I '<i>do</i>' ... if I '<i>should</i>' ... if I <i>shall</i> ... if I <i>will</i>
    ... if I <i>must</i> ... what can all the 'ifs' prove, but a most
    hypothetical state of the conscience? And in brief, I beg you to
    stand convinced of one thing, that whenever the 'certain time' comes
    for to 'hate writing to me' confessedly, 'avowedly,' (oh what words!)
    <i>I shall not like it at all</i>&mdash;not for all the explanations ... and the
    sights in gondola chairs, which the person seen is none the better
    for! The <span title="eidôlon">&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span> sits by the fire&mdash;the real Ba is cold at
    heart through wanting her letter. And that's the doctrine to be
    preached now, ... is it? I 'shrink,' shrink from it. That's your
    word!&mdash;and mine! Dearest, I began by half a jest and end by
    half-gravity, which is the fault of your doctrine and not of me I
    think. Yet it is ungrateful to be grave, when practically you are good
    and just about the letters, and generous too sometimes, and I could
    not bear the idea of obliging you to write to me, even once ...
    when.... Now do not fancy that I do not understand. I understand
    perfectly, on the contrary. Only do <i>you</i> try not to dislike writing
    when you write, or not to write when you dislike it ... <i>that</i>, I ask
    of you, dear dearest&mdash;and forgive me for all this over-writing and
    teazing and vexing which is foolish and womanish in the bad sense. It
    is a way of meeting, ... the meeting in letters, ... and next to
    receiving a letter from you, I like to write one to you ... and, so,
    revolt from thinking it lawful for you to dislike.... Well! the
    Goddess of Dulness herself couldn't have written <i>this</i> better,
    anyway, nor more characteristically.
</p>
<p>
    I will tell you how it is. You have spoilt me just as I have spoilt
    Flush. Flush looks at me sometimes with reproachful eyes 'a fendre le
    coeur,' because I refuse to give him my fur cuffs to tear to pieces.
    And as for myself, I confess to being more than half jealous of the
    <span title="eidôlon">&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span> in the gondola chair, who isn't the real Ba after
    all, and yet is set up there to do away with the necessity 'at certain
    times' of writing to her. Which is worse than Flush. For Flush, though
    he began by shivering with rage and barking and howling and gnashing
    his teeth at the brown dog in the glass, has learnt by experience what
    that image means, ... and now contemplates it, serene in natural
    philosophy. Most excellent sense, all this is!&mdash;and dauntlessly
    'delivered!'
</p>
<p>
    Your head aches, dearest. Mr. Moxon will have done his worst, however,
    presently, and then you will be a little better I do hope and
    trust&mdash;and the proofs, in the meanwhile, will do somewhat less harm
    than the manuscript. You will take heart again about 'Luria' ... which
    I agree with you, is more diffuse ... that is, less close, than any of
    your works, not diffuse in any bad sense, but round, copious, and
    another proof of that wonderful variety of faculty which is so
    striking in you, and which signalizes itself both in the thought and
    in the medium of the thought. You will appreciate 'Luria' in time&mdash;or
    others will do it for you. It is a noble work under every aspect. Dear
    'Luria'! Do you remember how you told me of 'Luria' last year, in one
    of your early letters? Little I thought that ever, ever, I should feel
    so, while 'Luria' went to be printed! A long trail of thoughts, like
    the rack in the sky, follows his going. Can it be the same 'Luria,' I
    think, that 'golden-hearted Luria,' whom you talked of to me, when you
    complained of keeping 'wild company,' in the old dear letter? And I
    have learnt since, that '<i>golden-hearted</i>' is not a word for him only,
    or for him most. May God bless you, best and dearest! I am your own to

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
